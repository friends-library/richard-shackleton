Letter 1.

[.signed-section-context-open]
7th month 1757.

It is four years since it pleased the Divine Being
to draw me in a manner (which is wonderful to me,
and which I cannot now comprehend) to draw me, I say, into a consideration of my state,
and repentance for my long backslidings,
and a desire for forgiveness and acceptance again.
In the infancy of those times, many were my sighs and tears,
but many were the promises which encouraged my perseverance in the path of judgment.
As I went on, I found the enemy of all good,
after having in vain assayed to cast me down below measure,
(by adding imaginary fuel to that of godly sorrow which works true repentance,)
endeavouring in the progress of my travel to elevate me too much,
by persuading me that now there was no necessity for so much mortification, self-denial,
and retiredness, as before.
And in this, to my shame, I will confess, he too often prevailed.
But through the tender mercy of the Father of mercies,
notwithstanding the working of the adversary upon a disposition naturally light, vain,
and inconstant, I have been preserved, if not always in the midst of the right path,
yet with my face always set that way.
And though instrumental helps do not affect me so much as formerly,
yet is my spirit often as much contrited as ever,
my heart as much enlarged in prayers and tears, and my desires after invisibles,
as strong as ever.
But, dear friend, here is my strait and difficulty,
that though I have as it were passed from the watchmen, yet still I find not him,
to my comfort, whom my soul loves; but the morning seems to be as far off,
as when I first perceived it was night;
and in this distress I am at times ready to cry out, Oh, will you never,
never appear! Surely none have been so dealt with as I!
Must I be the only one who seeks your face in vain?

One crumb, the smallest pittance, so it be the divine,
will suffice me!--then am I brought into the deepest humiliation,
and ready to make covenant, that I will be anything or nothing,
so that I may be admitted to be one of this family.
O surely it is a matter of great difficulty to be re-admitted,
so that those who are in any degree favoured with an abode here,
had need to use all diligence to obtain a settlement and establishment,
that they may go no more out.

Letter 2.

[.signed-section-context-open]
7th month 1752.

Though my ability is weak, my understanding and experience very little,
and my stability still less,
so that I am sure I am in a state which needs to receive advice and encouragement,
rather than give it; yet in my poor measure,
I am willing to do any little thing in my power for the good of my dear friends;
whom I sincerely love, for that cause, which more than all things,
I desire should prosper.
And therefore, dear cousin, I would invite you not to dainties,
for I have not for many years had any for myself;
but come along with me to a preparation and a capacity for receiving of them.
We must first be washed in the water of life before we can taste thereof.

The angel,
(the messenger of the covenant,) must be pleased first to descend and trouble the waters,
(our thoughts,
affections and desires,) then the lame must be washed therein before he can be healed.
This, which is the washing of regeneration,
is the first step to be made preparatory to the remission of sins
and witnessing the times of refreshment from before the Lord:
an operation which too many are not willing to undergo.
Like Naaman they think it too mean to wash in the little river of Jordan,
and like him they would have their change brought
about after some more great and powerful manner.
But my poor soul knows by the experience of some years, and by many and deep baptisms,
that the Almighty is indeed various in his operations,
working diversely on various hearts,
and causing the kingdom of Saul to grow weaker and weaker,
and the kingdom of David to grow stronger and stronger,
in a quicker or slower manner according to his own
wisdom in those whom it has pleased him to visit;
but that he is invariable in this, that he requires of each of us to seek unto him alone,
and follow him (not by imitation of others, but by the teachings of his own spirit,
with faithfulness, patience, humility,
and resignation) in that particular way which he has cast up for us to walk in.
And if we be engaged steadily to proceed herein,
we shall experience in our own particulars the fulfilling
of the dispensation antecedent to the coming of Christ,
namely, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord,
make straight his paths, or make straight in the desert a high way for our God.

Letter 3.

[.signed-section-context-open]
8th month 1752.

Many are the visited and called of the Lord, but few are his chosen.
The reason I believe is,
because all those who are visited are not faithful
to the little discoveries which are made to them:
some are too stubborn or cowardly to bear the cross, and others are too wise;
and by their reasoning and comparing, instead of obedience to the convictions of grace,
cause the eye which has in measure been opened,
to be closed again by the god of this world, and of the wisdom which is in it.
If you are determined, dear friend, in good earnest to press forward,
and endeavour to persevere to the end,
(for running well for a time will stand us in little
stead) keep nothing alive which should be slain,
give up cheerfully to the fire that chaffy combustible nature which is for the fire;
and let the sword of the Spirit pierce and divide that which is for the sword;
and as you are faithful herein you will know by degrees
judgment to be brought forth into victory,
and you shall in due season feel that peace which passes the understanding.

Letter 4.

[.signed-section-context-open]
4th month 1755.

We should labour to command our own spirits, which not being properly subjected,
I believe, often prevent the spirit of truth from reigning and governing in us:
without whose influence, how can we walk exemplary before our families and neighbours,
or be serviceable in the society.
I have thought that we are compound beings, and as we are a mixture of matter and spirit,
soul and body, so the soul has a mixture of the natural and spiritual,
which have a very close connection.
Neither is this connection between the natural and spiritual part of the soul any more
necessary to be divided for our well being (in some degree) in this life,
than the soul and body.
It is requisite that, in both cases, the natural be subject to the spiritual.
But as the improper usage of the body often stupifies the soul,
so the improper government of our own spirits often hinders
the arising into dominion of the spirit of truth.

Let us then, dear friend,
use all the means in our power to keep our own spirits in subjection,
and regulate our outward affairs as well as we can in order to attain that end;
and Providence, doubtless,
will not be lacking by supernatural aid to assist
us in subduing those enemies of our own house;
that so by degrees body, soul and spirit,
may be brought into a proper rectitude in his sight.
I think it is a very useful and essential part of knowledge,
to distinguish between the natural and spiritual both in ourselves and others,
in order to be rightly qualified for the service of this day.
But our own fallen wisdom can never comprehend this knowledge.
This is only to be learned of the word,
which the apostle compares to a sword that can make a division,
as between the joints and marrow, the soul and spirit.

Letter 5.

[.signed-section-context-open]
1st month 1761.

Surely some people or other, of honest plain and simple hearts,
will be raised up as witnesses to this life: for,
as to the generality of us now making profession of it, there are numbers,
who seem entirely unacquainted with the influence of it,
and neither to own it in their experience, nor confess it in their lives.
According to my little sense,
a spirit of ease and indifference has taken such strong root among us
that it must be some violent and terrible shock that will loosen it.
A declension is often and justly complained of,
but I wish we would each strictly examine ourselves, how far we are clear of it.
It has of late appeared to me that whoever through lack of watchfulness
or faithfulness does not come up in the rank and station allotted to him,
but falls short of the service designed him, comes short of the glory of God,
and contributes individually to this general declension,
though he may have been and still is the visited of the Lord, and a child of the family:
and when I consider the excellence and importance of the cause of true religion,
and what manner of persons those should be who are engaged to be active therein,
I have been ready to say, who is sufficient for these things?
These reflections above hinted seem however to have this good effect on myself,
that measuring what I am by what I ought to be, and perhaps might have been,
if it had not been my own fault,
I am made thoroughly sensible of my own weakness and worthlessness.
I wish I could as effectually get released from my failings, as I plainly see them,
and sometimes heartily lament them.

Letter 6.

[.signed-section-context-open]
5th month 1762.

We have been informed of your embarking in the uncertain
and precarious business of a boarding school.
It may well be termed embarking,
because it seems much to depend on the temper and caprice of others;
tempers fluctuating and changeable.
But as there is one whom the winds and seas obey,
so if we first and principally seek his blessing,
and demean ourselves at all times and in all places
with such a tender regard to his honour,
and fidelity to his testimony,
as will most certainly draw down his notice and favour upon us,
we shall do well in every respect; and if he causes us to be stewards over much,
he will teach us to use it to his honour:
if in his infinite and unsearchable wisdom he sees fit to grant but a little, the little,
with his blessing, will be sufficient and best.
For your own sake therefore, dear friend,
for the sake of your own true interest temporal and spiritual,
and for the sake of that most noble and glorious cause,
which blessed are they who (by their precept,
influence and example) contribute to help forward, every one in his rank and station,
even the cause of that religion which we profess, (Christianity in its purity,
undefiled with the mixture of worldly rites,
observations and ceremonies) be humble and steady, be much in retirement,
think nothing of yourself, think nothing of your person,
nothing of your parts either natural or improved; if you are elevated with any of these,
or any other consideration, you will never be truly honourable:
the eye of heaven will view your lofty dwelling with disapprobation,
for what is the most pompous state of man with respect
to personal accomplishments and acquisitions,
in the view of him, who charges even his angels with folly,
and the very heavens are not pure in his sight?
Consider what manner of person it is whom the sacred scriptures
bear record that the favourable regard of omnipotence is toward,
"`But to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit,
and trembles at my word.`"
But if you walk in such humility and self-abasement as the
true light will show you is altogether becoming your state,
condition and existence, if you diligently hearken to,
and faithfully obey the dictates of that holy principle of grace,
which is the criterion of our religious profession,
you will be in the favour and under the protection of divine Providence,
and no necessary good thing, spiritual or temporal, will be lacking.

8th month 1762.

That crafty enemy with whom we have to contend,
well knows how to turn the engines of our passions against our own souls,
to batter down the walls and bulwarks of our salvation;
he endeavours to draw out of the way the youth and middle aged,
by the allurements of deceitful pleasures,
or to encumber or retard them in it by the weight of worldly cares;
and if by the special favour and interposition of divine help,
they have escaped the baits laid for that season of life, and have arrived to old age;
neither there are they safe of themselves.
He attacks the old with their own natural infirmities of body and mind,
so nearly connected, that the one often affects the other,
if they have lived from youth to age in serving themselves only,
and in insensibility as to religion, his business is to rock them to sleep still,
till they sleep the sleep of death:
but if in the more active part of life they have been quickened with a sense of good,
and been enabled to do something for this blessed cause,
he would endeavour to turn their view to what they have done;
as though that was some merit and some honour to them,
and as though that was sufficient for them:
he would make use of the heaviness and inaction natural to that
stage of life to prevent them from that lively exercise of spirit,
in which both young and old must witness their minds to be cleansed and renewed,
not only for every day`'s particular service, which it brings along with it,
while we are in the body,
but which is absolutely necessary for the preservation of the life of our own souls.

Oh, that I may come to be more and more weaned from the love of the world,
its friendships and its wisdom, and all the wit and devices of my restless enemy, self.
And this has been, and I hope will be, my desire for you;
that you may more and more be enamoured with the plainness and simplicity of the truth,
and by keeping low in the light,
may see and escape the subtlety of the serpent in all his seemingly glorious transformations,
in all his efforts to puff you up, and all his splendid enticements to deceive.
You know far better than I where and how he is best seen and avoided,
and where your great strength lies; but my unfeigned love for you,
and not any distrust of your stability, or information from anyone,
prompts and emboldens me to take this freedom with you.
It is my knowledge of your good qualities,
which the great giver of all good has (for a purpose of his own glory) endowed you with,
and not your bad ones (for such are unknown to me)
that makes me so much desire your preservation,
and that those gifts and graces may be kept pure and chaste without any base alloy:
which I hope and believe they hitherto are.

Letter 9.

[.signed-section-context-open]
9th month 1752.

My beloved friend,
how sensible am I of the necessity of a total and absolute
resignation and subjection of our will to the divine will,
if we ever come to be truly profitable to ourselves,
or fit instruments in the Lord`'s hand for carrying on his work effectually in the earth.
I cannot but think that if our wills were thus yoked,
the work would not only go on more prosperously,
but be far easier to the instruments of it,
if our own wills were thoroughly mortified and self of no reputation.

When the opposers of truth raged and struck against the testimony of it,
they might indeed grieve that which bore witness for the truth in the instrument,
but could not gratify their malice in grieving the instrument itself,
because self in it being already quite abased and in the dust,
the arrow would fly ineffectually over its head.
According to my small judgment,
this habitual prostration of self would be an excellent preservative,
not only against being too much affected by the good will and applause,
but also against being so much troubled and afflicted
by the malice and bitterness of men.
It is a kind of balking the devil and his agents; for being already in the valley,
it is impossible for them to cast us from an eminence.

The sorrows and heaviness which the Lord brings over his people immediately,
for his own wise purposes, or which are permitted to befall them by adverse accidents,
or sometimes by means of the wicked, which, (as the psalmist says) are his sword;
these are, or may be, for the preparing of the heart for his service,
or for weaning from this transitory world and the love of it;
and the Lord is pleased often to sweeten such bitter cups;
the troubles which we bring on ourselves, through our own unwatchfulness,
I know by experience, lie with a dead weight upon us;
and from such I heartily pray that both I, and those whom I love, may be delivered.

You are near to us,
time nor distance have not obliterated the memory of those
seasons when we have been blended into one spirit by baptism,
and deep has spoken unto deep.
Such is the unity,
such the friendship and fellowship which is among
the children born again of the spiritual birth,
which the world knows not of.
May this union still grow, my beloved, among us,
and prayer and supplication be more and more put up on one another`'s behalf;
that we may be enabled to do our day`'s work while here,
and hereafter join the assembly of those pure spirits which are ever employed
in celebrating the praise of the author of all our happiness.

My spirit bows within me in admiration of that glorious hand which
raises the human creature that is passive and obedient to his will,
to little less than the dignity of an angel, and crowns it with glory and honour;
anointing it with oil above its fellows,
who indeed have souls capable of the same refinement and exaltation,
but for lack of giving up all,
and from being wedded to one little lower delight or another,
move in less exalted orbits.

Go on, my dear friend, in the diligent exercise of your gift:
keep your own hands and heart clean, and you will certainly grow stronger and stronger.
Every new faithful discharge of duty will strengthen the root of life in you,
and will be a means of laying up more treasure in heaven,
which you will enjoy in fulness at last, when a few more battles are fought,
a few more bitter cups are drunk, a few more troubles from the wicked are over.
Have a care of the world, beware of its connections and its prospects;
it is of a sticking nature, it is hard to touch it,
without getting something of it upon us;
if we do not receive the mark (visibly) in our foreheads,
we may be in danger of having it secretly in our right hands,
and how then can we apply them to the work?
will not the savour of the defilement, (though it be but small) be perceived by the wise,
to be upon that which we have handled; how then will it prosper?

6th Mo 1761.

You are now a man of experience,
and should endeavour for such a growth as the apostle witnessed, who once was a child,
but afterwards in all stations learned to be content.
I have thought more than usual of late of the withdrawing
of the glory from the assemblies of our society.
I am jealous that it lamentably increases.
What then must they do,
who are yet in infinite mercy and condescension measurably preserved alive?
What, but increase in the diligence and deepness of private retirement,
wearing sackcloth as within on their flesh?
I desire above all things a capacity for this inward steady waiting frame of spirit,
being well assured that it is the safest state for ourselves,
and most acceptable to the majesty of heaven.
May a sense and dread of his majesty (before whom
we have a great and important work to do,
important to ourselves and important by our example to others,) I say,
may his holy fear be ever so before our eyes, as to preserve us from sinning in thought,
word, or deed, against him.

I would have you (for many reasons) to be exemplarily generous in contributing
to this and all other public expenses relative to the good of the society.
Let us show that we have its welfare at heart, and that we are willing to act,
as well as speak for the cause:
there has been too great deficiency in this respect among some worthies;
it has hurt their service while they were living,
and whose is what they saved now they are dead?

Many individuals of our profession, who are rich in this world, are not so in good works,
nor active in helping a good work forward.
They have not only deviated from the Christian life and manners,
which we are called to hold forth to the view of the world:
but they seem sunk below the human and rational into the brutish nature;
their god is their belly,
and their glory is their shame; their ultimate view
and desire seems to be to accumulate wealth,
and gratify their sensual appetites; and if our society, as some other bodies corporate,
was mainly supported by money,
I believe sooner than be at any considerable expense in supporting it,
they would let the testimony of truth fall to the ground and sink into oblivion,
as they now trample upon and dishonour it by their lives and conduct.

Letter 15.

[.signed-section-context-open]
12th month 1763.

I note your remarks, and acknowledge the justice of them; this wrath of man (of which,
pride, imperiousness,
self-will and caprice are branches) neither wills nor works the righteousness of God;
it does no good: it weakens the reason, lessens the authority,
and exposes the nakedness of all who are possessed by it, and act under its influence;
they are men of low degree,
and (in my opinion) if they will not submit to a proper subordination,
and quietly learn of wisdom and her children,
they had better be passed by as improper to be confederated with;
they will then indulge their own private bitterness and rancour:
and they will need no other chastiser,
for the fool makes a rod sufficient for his own back.
Not only in the present case, but in most cases affecting the society,
we find the middling or lower class most willing to bear the burden,
to conform to discipline,
and come into method unitedly for carrying matters into execution;
the rich have money and many of them hardly any other qualification of value;
if some of them had given something considerable towards this work,
perhaps the opposition which they would therefore think they had a right
to make to some salutary schemes for establishing and promoting it,
would do more hurt than their money would do good.
It requires, dear friend, much of that wisdom which dwells with prudence,
to treat with these rich men;-- to petition them (as it were) to give
some of their substance towards the conservation of the society,
when we know their lives are opposite to the true interests of it,
and that they are unfit to communicate with us;-- to seem to want their money,
and to treat with them for that, when it is themselves we want,
and earnestly desire that they themselves may come
into and be cherished by the warm bosom of the church.
So that,
(only that we are all in general so little) I would choose that those who are least,
rather than ambassadors of the first rank from Christ Jesus to his people,
should be put upon the office of soliciting for money
from them for the contingent expenses of society.

I see more and more that I was not cut out to be a man for this world,
not one of the wise ones and the great ones of the earth;
nor since my thoughts took a religious turn, did I ever expect, or desire it.
I can honestly say,
that the greatest delight and satisfaction that I ever have in present possession,
is to feel the baptism of the spirit to wash my heart,
and unite it to the seed in the bitter sense of suffering;
and the most pleasing contemplation that I have in future prospect in this life,
is to see the prosperity of truth,
and to be favoured with liberty and capacity to serve the cause thereof in my generation.
And for the integrity of this declaration I dare appeal to the searcher of all hearts,
who has even now tendered my spirit in humble prostration before him.
And I am glad to feel a renewal of this sacred baptism,
(which first cemented our early acquaintance,
and I trust will preserve our fellowship unbroken to the end,)
while I thus converse (without any premeditation) with you.

I seem not to have any repository of my own, from which I might impart any good thing.
So far from it, I am so exceedingly reduced,
so complete a bankrupt in my spiritual circumstances, so poor,
so beset and embarrassed on all sides, that I never knew, heard,
or read of anyone like me.
I am, or at least feel to myself, so weak at times,
that I seem as if I could hardly hold together.
Such is the person to whom you unbosom your griefs.
Perhaps this short recital of my own state, compared with your own feelings,
may administer some species of relief when you find that others are afflicted,
tossed with tempests, and not comforted, as well as yourself.
You rightly, and I doubt not experimentally, remark,
that effectual relief must come from the Father who sees in secret.
He made us externally and visibly what we are,
and endued us with our several organs of existence and preservation.
It is he who (if we be passive under his hand, forming our minds,
as we were under the same hand fashioning our bodies,
of which we cannot make a single hair white or black,) will construct, unite,
confirm and strengthen in his own time the various parts of our inward man;
and will endue the same with those spiritual senses necessary for its preservation,
and for its ability to act properly in the service of its great Creator.
O my friend, wonderfully are we made.
My spirit, as is I doubt not yours and your beloved spouse`'s
is often deeply bowed in humble petition,
that Divine Providence may so steer and pilot our
several barks through the dangerous seas of life,
that whatever wind from external circumstances blows, whether high or low,
prosperous or adverse, whether the waves be rough or smooth, whether storms or calms,
betide us, we may, enduring all with patience, waiting with quiet submission,
not without at times, a hope and expectation,
be conducted safe at last into the harbour of eternal rest.
Should everything in the voyage be quiet, easy, commodious and agreeable to our wishes,
we might perhaps grow presumptuous,
and by the interfering of our own carnal wills and wisdom
take our bark as it were out of the hands of the good pilot,
and run it against some rocks, where it might perish forever.

4th month 1787.

You have heard no doubt of our dear friend having uncovered his head, his anointed head,
in the religious assemblies in Dublin.
My heart was glad when I heard it.
And the desire of my spirit is,
that many more may in all humility and prostration of self, wait in the deeps;
each keeping to their own peculiar exercise,
till they receive qualification and ability to bring up their stones of memorial,
living stones, polished and fitted in the depths from which they are brought.
I have seen many sweet and promising blossoms fair and fragrant,
from which delicious fruits might have been expected in due season; many hopeful youths,
of both sexes, whom the Lord has been graciously pleased to visit,
and to open an eye in them to see the beauty and excellence which is in the truth,
and to view this world as it really is;--but there has not been
a following on to know the Lord in progressive stages of advancement,
there has not been a sufficiently diligent waiting for the re-baptizing
which purges and makes clean from all defilement of flesh and spirit,
nor for the re-anointing, which keeps the internal eye open,
to see things natural and things spiritual in the proper light: so there is a dwindling,
a decaying, a dwarfishness in stature; a deficiency in measure and weight;
and the vacant seats of the princes and nobles, removing from works to rewards,
are not effectually filled up; so that defect and weakness have overspread,
the dignity of the church is lowered, and her authority,
which stands in the life and in the power of truth, is greatly diminished.
If you are persuaded that these things are so, my dear+++_________+++,
do you and some of your near connections look about you, and see whereabouts you are;
let not the cares of this life supersede your concern in
those things which relate to a better that is to come.
While you are commendably and moderately diligent in outward business,
be diligent and fervent in spirit,
serving the Lord and his cause with your best in your generation.
Above all things feel after the dew of heaven;
and as much of the fatness of the earth as is suitable for you will be added.
Let the pure truth and its heavenly wisdom circumscribe
your desires and designs in all things;
you will find its government and direction most profitable,
both as to the life which now is, and that which is to come.

It`'s parent`'s affliction for the loss of that dear
departed youth I doubt not has been very considerable:
these events are not without the ordering of an all-wise agent,
who has many a wheel within a wheel in his great economy.
Very likely in mercy he snatched away this youth,
now rescued from the temptations of a dangerous troublesome world:
he loosened one of these ties,
by which some of the survivors were connected perhaps
too closely to present visible enjoyments,
showed the fallacy and uncertainty of human prospects, and I trust,
effected thereby on some of their minds a more solid thought of, and preparation for,
that awful period which hastens with uninterrupted speed upon us all.
If we be happily preserved to steer well through this state of probation,
we shall go to our beloved friends and acquaintance who are gone well before us,
but they cannot return to us.
This is a strong incitement to watchfulness and care,
and shows the vanity of a redundance of grief.

I did not hear before your intelligence of the actress you mention.
Such tidings are very agreeable: but would be much more so,
if they brought account of a humble, diligent, steady perseverance in the party.
Many no doubt are visited by the power of that gospel
which is preached in every human creature;
and several are animated with good desires and resolutions to be obedient to it:
but when the tempter comes, practising on the inclinations, affections, and passions,
and plying his batteries against that side which is most easily beset,
for lack of the creature waiting for the help of the all-sufficient grace,
but dallying with, and listening to the temptation,
instead of growing from strength to strength through faithfulness in the little,
the soul becomes weaker and weaker, loses its hold of the means of its salvation,
and is in danger of perishing forever.

You and I, my dear friend,
are blessed with beloved spouses and true help-mates agreeable to our wish:
we have also a tender hopeful progeny.
May we be constantly waiting to feel our spirits seasoned with divine grace,
and keep near that holy life,
by which we may be enabled by example and precept
to answer the just witness in their consciences,
and help them forward in the right road: not only suffering,
but earnestly persuading the little children to come unto Christ,
whose arms are still extended to receive them.

Submit we must: our lives, the lives of all we hold dear to us,
and every comfort we extract from everything,
are in the hand of omnipotence and under his control;
how awfully should we then walk before him who is
the source of every blessing to his depending children,
and who on the other hand (as a certain author most beautifully
remarks) can disquiet the soul and vex it in all its faculties.
I have been led very lately to ponder a good deal on the uncertainty of our tranquillity,
and the necessity of the interposition of that great power,
to preserve us alive in every respect.
Doubtless, whatever may be our trials, or from whatever quarter they may come,
if we watch steadily unto prayer, if we keep a conscience void of offence,
if we look to the Lord for succour, we shall be helped through one difficulty,
and one exercise after another, till our measure of suffering is filled up,
and our weary spirits are admitted into that holy rest prepared
for those who through faith have overcome in this dangerous warfare.

At present,
there is cause for much gratitude on account of the
day of prosperity which we are favoured with.
By and by no doubt comes, in the revolution of the seasons, a day of adversity,
equally good and profitable for us.
May we all, my dear friend,
so improve the merciful visitations of heavenly regard and notice,
that whether the north or south wind blow upon our gardens,
the Lord`'s plantation in us may flourish and bring forth fruit,
to the praise of the good and gracious husbandman.
I am persuaded that his fatherly intention is to do good to your father`'s house,
and to make it useful and honourable to and among his people.
But many, very many, are the dangers and temptations from within and from without,
which await the necessary cares of this life:
and the pursuit of things lawful from the purest and noblest motives,
if carried to an improper excess, may clog the feet of the inward man,
and prevent his running with alacrity the race which, by divine appointment,
is set before him.
The seeking of great things, the aspiring after this world`'s grandeur,
the imitating and, emulating others who are not devoted in body, soul,
spirit and substance to the cause of truth, hurts the tender plant of renown,
and retards its growth.

But to be diligent in the spirit of our minds, often cultivating seasons of retirement,
watching daily and hourly unto prayer for preservation from evil and for divine acceptance,
witnessing from time to time that baptism which cleanses
from all defilement of flesh and spirit,
doing nothing which we are persuaded in the secret of our own minds is wrong,
and being faithful to every manifestation of active duty;
this I believe is the way to draw down the blessing of heaven.
and perpetuate it among us,

Infirmities of various kinds are by the appointment
of Infinite Wisdom allotted to our nature,
and one disorder or other, with more or less speed,
will work the decay of the mortal part of us all:
some disorders hurry us with pain and anguish out of life,
as it were with open force and violence,
while others gradually undermine the constitution;
and the absence of much pain causing a flattering hope of longer continuance,
the frail tabernacle is dissolved before we are well aware.
In this, in that, in every circumstance of life or death, there is one, and but one,
sure hope to anchor our tossed tried vessel; namely,
the earnest of eternal rest and peace.
This has made the deathbed, even when agonizing pain of body has attended,
as a bed of roses,
and the pale messenger has been welcomed as one come
to release the soul from the fetters of mortality,
that it may take its flight into the regions of pure joy,
and unmixed undisturbed felicity.

I read your last, and attended to the contents with a mind impressed with sorrow,
and indeed sorrow and trouble are at times spread before me on
account of the situation of things in our religious society.
What is the reason that many educated among us should
be such enemies to the truth which they profess?
Yes, the enmity of their spirits (like thick darkness) is to be felt:
What must be opposed to these fiery darts?
For my part,
I know nothing more likely for the honest-hearted to defend
themselves withal and preserve their own spirits,
nor by which they may overcome the agents of the wicked one,
than the power of gospel love.
This, if patiently kept to, will work wonders: this is invincible,
and its armour impenetrable.
But if this be in any measure departed, from,
or adulterated with self-love (which is the parent of resentment)
it causes a breach in the panoply (the whole armour) of God,
who is love, and so leaves some weak part unguarded, to be wounded and hurt.
If any therefore have been injured or hurt,
to a deep search after the healing virtue of this divine love,
I would earnestly recommend them; and as this becomes predominant in the mind,
it will influence to say and do these things, and these only, which make for peace;
and it will bear down all before it, and in due time re-possess the gates of its enemies.

I can conceive by past sorrowful experience the trouble your family must be in,
on the distressing occasion which you mention;
and more especially such of you as are connected with the testimony of truth,
which is wounded by this affair; but such have always this encouragement,
that those who suffer for, and with, the testimony, are supported inwardly by it,
and in so much greater degree as they are tender of it,
and prefer it before the ties of blood, of natural affection or any other consideration.
It looks to me as if this dispensation would be fruitful of refining baptism to you,
and I heartily wish that you may patiently abide the day (or say the night) of it,
and I believe you will find all work together for good.
But beware of sinking too low in your minds,
keep as attentive as possible to feel after solid comfort,
and to hear the dictates of the small still voice, in following which there is safety.
I think the enemy will not be idle at this juncture,
but be apt to whisper that things having gone amiss in your own family,
you are much disqualified from intermeddling in the families of others,
and that you are not now proper persons to stand
forth in the cause of our discipline in the church.
This is the whispering of Satan; he is a liar, and believe him not.
Our children and every individual in our families have the
same divine principle and sufficient grace as ourselves,
and in our obedience to it consists our common preservation.
If we be careful to live under its law, and thereby be good examples to them:
if seasoned by this, when fresh capacity is afforded,
we bring forth now and then such food for our household as we have,
though only fragments;
if we watch unto prayer for the blessing and protection of Providence over them and us,
what more is required, or what more can be done?
When, after all, those that are intimately connected with us by friendship,
or relationship, swerving from the fear of God, and regard to the admonition of man,
violate the law of a good conscience, and the rules established in the society,
let us impartially give our judgment with zeal against them,
and know no man after the flesh.
This is what will conduce to our own peace and strength,
disappoint the expectation of those who may watch over us for evil,
and may be a means of awakening the party that has
offended to ponder more deeply on the offence,
and seek more earnestly a place of repentance and restoration.
Though I write thus, I have no suspicion of any contrary conduct in you,
but believe you will act as those who are sensible that many eyes are over you,
and particularly that eye which penetrates into the deepest recesses of our hearts,
and knows the most secret movements of our thoughts; the eye of a God,
jealous indeed of his honour,
yet full of compassion and merciful regard to his
poor afflicted devoted children and servants,
who faithfully serve and submissively rely upon him.

I think I have seen that your heavenly Father and Merciful Creator,
has been graciously pleased to visit you in your dangerous stage of youth,
and that his intention, if you do not frustrate it, is to do you good.
Permit then, my dear friend, with humble resignation, the operation of his purging power.
Leave yourself in his hand, and cast your care upon him.
Be diligent above all things to feel after the stirrings of a divine life in your soul,
and wait patiently for its tendering, cleansing baptisms.
Oh, this diligent waiting and inward retiredness of spirit! This you will find is the very
source and supply of your ability and capacity to hold out in a religious growth.
This is what I most earnestly recommend to you as
the great and principal means of renewing your strength.
If you rightly learn this lesson of retirement,
you will soon be a ripe scholar in religion, and need not that any man teach you,
but as the holy anointing will teach you in these seasons of waiting,
and imbue your mind with an understanding of those things which belong to your only true,
present, and future everlasting peace.
I am greatly mistaken if the good will of heaven is not towards you in particular,
and I hope to more of your father`'s house.
My sincere desire is that you may be so wise in heart, so true to your own best interest,
as not to reject the offers of such gracious favour and condescension,
but thankfully embrace them as your chiefest good.

I have thought of you with concern,
knowing by experience the dangers that unexperienced youth is liable to.
The reins have been much left on your own neck, to run on according to your own pleasure.
You have girded yourself according to your own liking, and gone where you would.
And it is of the mercy of your great Creator,
if you have been preserved hitherto from falling into the enormities and corruptions,
as I doubt you have stepped too much into the vanities
and follies of the world and its spirit.
However, the past is irrecoverable; I would have you make a stand now,
and in the cool hour of sober reflection ask yourself,
whether you have felt more solid satisfaction in the time of dissipation and libertinism,
which has since elapsed, than in those seasons of the earlier part of your youth,
when your heart was humbled within you under a sense of your own unworthiness,
and your spirit tendered by the visits of divine grace:
visits which were afforded you by that same great Creator, in wonderful condescension,
that your mind might be pre-engaged to love, fear and serve him,
before the heated imagination and growing passions of more advanced youth,
and your designs and connections on the verge of manhood,
might warp your conduct from the simplicity and safety which is in the blessed truth.
You know best whether you still enjoy those tendering sensations of divine favour,
or whether you have bartered this precious birth-right for foolish, fleeting,
empty gratifications, which will stand you in no stead in the day of trouble;
which tend only to estrange and set you at a distance from your Almighty Benefactor,
who can bless or blast all your endeavours;
and which preclude you from that frequency of fellowship with your best friends,
by whose communion, and good counsel, you might be profited and helped every way.

I note what you say of your inward conflicts.
I doubt not your having commenced, and in a good degree successfully carried on that war,
which must subsist (while we are in these bodies) between the flesh and spirit,
from generation to generation.
I wish we may be enabled still to carry it on, till all our enemies be subdued;
the greatest being, I believe, (as you observe) those of our own houses, or hearts.
Let us ever bear in mind, that if we would effectually make war in righteousness,
our weapons must be spiritual, not carnal.
That which is born of the flesh is only flesh: and the flesh profits not in this warfare.
Hence I fear often arise these repeated conflicts and struggles, which leave us weak,
and do not help on the work; when mixing with some certain company,
or engaged in certain hurries and business, we are not watchful enough over our spirits,
to possess (keep) these vessels in sanctification
and in that honour which adorns our high profession,
but suffer more or less defilement.
And then again, when religious company, conversation, and affairs present,
we feel our lack and weakness,
and in our own time and wills would be relieved and eagerly abound.
Then the impatience of our spirits would set us to work,
and tempt to force the (unacceptable) sacrifice;
then we perhaps seek relief and help by complaining to, and conversing with,
the approved servants: who if they be wise in heart, are often shut up from such a state,
and find it their duty to keep their own to themselves.
These voluntary strivings are of the flesh, or too much mixed with it,
so cannot enter the kingdom, which is not to be taken by this kind of violence.
But, dear friend, if we would steadily follow on to know the Lord,
if we would enjoy him to our solid, permanent comfort, and be willing to be anything,
or nothing, in his hand, we must know great stripping and many humble baptisms;
and if we passively and patiently abide under the refining, forming hand,
we shall be dipped into many tribulating dispensations,
which in the course of their operation,
will reduce us and our rational powers as men (which are
only appertaining to us as being also flesh) exceeding low:
so that our sight, with all our other spiritual senses, being purged and clear,
we shall see that truly of ourselves we can do nothing;
we shall be more and more weaned from temporary aids,
and more and more learn this lesson, to cease from man, even the best of men,
and have our sole dependance on the Lord Almighty,
who is the primary source and supply of every substantial good.

You live in a place distant from the body of friends belonging to the monthly meeting;
and are in more danger, from such a situation,
of being leavened with the spirit and manners of other people,
who though they may be of irreproachable characters among men,
yet are not brought up in a belief of,
nor directed to feel after the quickening virtue
and operation of that saving grace in the heart,
which is the only effectual preservative of men from the corruptions of the world.
You plead for your absence, that you are married, have a prospect of a growing family,
must attend to a provision for it, and therefore that you cannot come,
acknowledge that it is highly proper and commendable
in you to be diligent in your outward business,
and to provide by honest means for a decent livelihood.
Many of us do the same, and yet knowing the uncertain tenure we have of all things here,
and that it is the divine blessing alone which gives
the true relish to the enjoyment of them,
we dare not be so ungrateful to our great benefactor,
so disrespectful to our Lord and master,
and so unfaithful to the common cause of our holy religion,
as frequently to neglect the assembling of ourselves together,
in order to wait for a capacity to perform acceptable worship to the Father of spirits,
and to assist in conducting the discipline established in the society;
and as you would desire that you and yours should be partakers of those
spiritual and temporal blessings which are in the Lord`'s hand to bestow,
as well as others, why should not you as well as others demonstrate your love to him,
and attachment to his cause,
by a humble devotion of your time and talents to the author of your existence?
It is absurd to think, and he well deserves the appellation of fool who imagines,
that his secular affairs will succeed worse,
because leaving them settled in a prudent manner,
he attends his religious duties as a member of Christian society.
Whose are the cattle on a thousand hills?
Whose is the earth and the fulness thereof?
Who lent us for a short uncertain space these conveniences of life?
and, Who can take them from us, or us from them, at his pleasure?

But it is reported,
that you are so far from joining with us in support of the
hedge of discipline which the Lord has planted about us,
that you are for pulling it down:
that so far from making a sacrifice of any little
part of your substance to the support of our testimony,
you are for sacrificing the testimony of truth to a little sordid gain;
and instead of walking in the way of our worthy ancestors, that you are,
in the days of your youth and prosperity,
ready to trample on the testimony which they bore through many afflictions,
and several of them sealed with the loss of their lives,
I mean our testimony against the payment of tithes,
or contributing actively to the support of a hireling ministry.
It would exceed the ordinary limits of a letter,
even to touch upon the numerous arguments which might be brought,
both from right reason and holy scripture, against this anti-christian yoke;
therefore I refer you for satisfaction in this point,
to those writings on this subject which are common in the families of friends;
and at present would just caution you not obstinately,
after repeated advice to the contrary,
to violate so material a branch of our Christian testimony,
which cost our predecessors so dear;
because by persisting in the resolution which I am told you have formed in this respect,
you will, in a great measure, break the bond of fellowship with our religious society,
and I believe it will not prosper with you.

I note your desire to be acquainted with true religion, and that you have read books,
and cultivated acquaintance with such as might be likely to instruct you in it.
Indeed the generality of people bestow very little solid thought about religious matters:
and if any should be more inquisitive than ordinary,
concerning the way of life and salvation,
they are branded often with the name of Quakers, Methodists, Fanatics, or Enthusiasts.
However, ridicule is by no means the test of truth,
and right and wrong remain irreconcilable things;
the former is worth all the pains of our deep search, and investigation,
the latter it concerns us to avoid with the most cautious circumspection.
It certainly is not consistent with the nobility and excellence of a rational mind,
to adopt the most important principles connected
with our everlasting interest merely upon trust,
and by tradition: the religion of our education while we were children,
should be the religion of our feelings and of our
judgment when we arrive at maturity of understanding,
or it should be changed for that which is so.
Nor is such a change in any degree degrading to the party that makes it,
when it is done purely from conscientious motives; on the contrary,
it is rational and laudable, and has the sanction of apostolical precept,
"`Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.`"
But a change of religious profession, barely, will stand us in little stead;
the unregenerate man or woman must witness a change of nature,
which is a change from nominal to real religion, from shadow to substance,
from the name to the thing; and in effecting this,
true Christianity is learned by experience,
and by experience we know and feel the meaning of the terms,
and the efficacy of the means employed in this great mystery.
People may talk about regeneration, faith, baptism, sanctification, justification,
etc. and may reason concerning the progress of the work of religion in the soul,
but if they do not know and feel it going on in themselves,
they are no more benefited by their head knowledge,
than the man who is languishing for lack of food, is strengthened by talking of eating.
We are to receive these things as little children,
waiting in the simplicity of our hearts, and abstractedness of thought,
to be fed by the Divine Hand, with food convenient for us.
If we trust in the Lord with all our hearts, and lean not to our own understanding,
he will lead us on gradually, feed us according to our growth,
and inform our understanding in the things of his kingdom,
as we shall be able to bear or comprehend them.
I wish you dear friend, to be still in your mind,
to guard against restlessness and impatience,
to employ yourself quietly and cheerfully in your outward occupation (which will
help to prune away a redundance of unprofitable thoughts,) and to be diligent
in waiting for and feeling after that spring of comfort in your own mind,
which is not under your control, nor at your command,
nor can be come at by the working of any artificial tool of our imagination;
but which the great master sends in his own time, "`To revive the spirit of the humble,
and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.`"

A personal interview is pleasing,
when it can be enjoyed in a degree of calmness and quiet;
but as many things combine to prevent that,
I wish us to meet often in spirit--"`Absent in body, yet present in spirit.`"
In this, my first acquaintance and fellowship with you was formed,
before I personally knew you; in this it has been renewed and confirmed.

I travail for you, dear children, that Christ may be formed in you,
that you may be complete in him, lacking nothing.
The cry of my heart for you has repeatedly been,
that the Lord would make you such as he would have you to be.
If left to ourselves,
and to model ourselves and our demeanour according to patterns which in
our own judgment we may set down as most excellent and worthy of imitation,
our inward man will be apt to grow feeble and distorted,
and its constitution sickly and unsound;
but leaving ourselves to the Lord Almighty to create in us a clean heart,
and renew a right spirit within us, diligently waiting in nothingness of self,
out of our own willings and strivings,
for the descending of the power of truth to contrite and baptize our spirits,
we shall witness a being melted down and moulded anew into whatever utensil,
form and size, the maker pleases.
Here is the great matter on our parts, even to be passive in the Divine hand,
as clay in the hand of the potter.
The mixture of our own imaginations is what we are carefully to watch against,
being the thing which mars the perfection and sullies the beauty of the Lord`'s work.
All that he makes is unmixedly good;
so the more simply and unreservedly we submit ourselves
to be prepared and fashioned by him,
the more of that unmixed good, will be in our spiritual composition,
and the nearer we shall approach to the highest perfection of our natures,
the fulfilling the precept of Christ, "`Be perfect therefore,
even as your Father who is in heaven is perfect.`"

I like that they should engage in such acts as will show they are
not in alliance with the enemies of God`'s true Israel.
There must and will be enmity between the two seeds.

My spirit has waded in the deeps many a time, in travail for the visited youth,
that not one grain of the heavenly seed might be lost, nor unfruitful;
and now my cry is that they may "`go forward.`"
They have many of them been tied up from the further sallies of their own wild nature;
they have known the discipline of the cross; and now the Master has need of them,
(alluding to the passage in Mat.
21st chap.) he calls for their service in the church.
Indeed they can never serve a better master--his service dignifies the meanest talents;
and the brightest, if they tend not to promote it, are but meanly employed.
This world, its bustle, its pursuits, and its highest glory,
will soon be over to every one that is at present in it.

She is now released from those long infirmities which
infinite wisdom permitted her to pass through,
for the trial of her faith and patience,
and for her preparation for an admittance into that rest,
into which nothing impure can enter.
Refined and polished while here for the company of blessed spirits,
she is (I doubt not) mingled in their happy society.
We remain a little longer to struggle with the difficulties,
and encounter the temptations, which belong to this life.
We are not yet putting off our harness, therefore have no reason to boast,
but to dwell in awful fear.
We are some of us the heads of families, and principal persons in our places:
our precepts and our example therefore must have considerable weight and
influence. How necessary is it for us then to ask wisdom of him,
who gives liberally and upbraids not;
that by rightly fulfilling all our several duties in our families and in the church,
we may, as we pass along in our journey,
have the answer in our consciences of "`Well done!--good and faithful servant,
enter into the joy of your Lord,`" as well as that
happy sentence at the close of this visible scene?

My mind, while I am thus engaged,
is turned with tender solicitude towards your beloved offspring.
I believe that many of them (and most probably all of them)
have felt the gentle touches of the Divine Hand,
and the invitations of the good spirit in the secret of their souls,
drawing them from the spirit of the world, in its manifold appearances,
and begetting in them desires and aspirations after enduring substance.
May they with all diligence cultivate the renewal of these tendering impressions,
and in all humility submit to the operation of these cleansing baptisms,
which purify the heart, and make it a fit receptacle for unmixed good.
A gracious Providence has not been lacking in his visitations to the youth among us;
but there has been a great lack in them of following on to know
the Lord in the renewed experience of his humbling power,
and in the further manifestations of his will concerning them;--hence the goodness
of too many of them is but like the morning cloud and early dew;
it is soon superceded by a relish for the pomps and vanities of this world,
and their baptismal vows are soon forgotten;
and hence a lack of succession of testimony bearers to the noblest cause, which ever did,
or ever will, dignify human nature.
I particularly wish for the elder branches of your numerous hopeful stock,
as now a greater charge devolves upon them,
that they may seek and wait for heavenly wisdom to direct their own steps,
and influence every part of their conduct;
that so they may grow in favour with their great Creator,
and in his hand be made a blessing to the younger branches of the family,
assisting to train them up, by example and precept, in the life of religion,
and in that plainness and simplicity which adorn our holy profession.

I have repeatedly heard of your appearances in a few words in public and private opportunities,
and no doubt, in diffidence and fear.
I need not tell you that it is a great and solemn
office to be an ambassador between God and the people.
I am persuaded that you are sensible of it,
and that it is the sincere desire of your heart to be found in the way of your duty.
In your infant state you will very probably have many doubts,
questionings and reasonings: but as the eye is kept single to the one object,
the faithful discharge of duty, the whole inward man,
will be full of light--enlightened and enabled to walk in the right path,
and if fears and jealousies of self should arise,
they are not to be fought against in the will of the creature;
but words and actions are to be brought to the light of Christ,
that they may be there tried whether they have been wrought and spoken in God,
i+++.+++ e. whether they have the seal of his spirit.
Where self is sufficiently abased,
and only to will and to do of the Master`'s good pleasure is the dominant principle,
there is not much danger of an honest mind being long under a deception.
The feeling of one`'s own mind, and the concurrent testimony of the living, will,
like the mouth of two witnesses, establish every word:
and though for wise purposes there may be for a season, as it were, a chaos, and a void,
and darkness upon the face of the deep;
yet as the operation of the spirit of truth in your soul is diligently waited for,
and the turning of his holy hand is patiently borne and submitted to,
he will (I trust) in his own time, "`Bring forth your righteousness as the light,
and your judgment as the noon-day.`"

It was very pleasing to hear that it proved consistent
with the Divine will to lengthen out your short span,
to add a few days more to your pilgrimage.
To those engaged in the same warfare it is a matter of gladness and strength
to have their companions continued to them. You know what this world is;
a place of danger, temptation and perplexity;
a place where we exceedingly need Almighty help, protection and direction;
we need the fear of the Lord to be ever before our eyes, that we may be solid, weighty,
steady in the face of our families, and our connections and familiar acquaintance;
we greatly need wisdom, fresh and fresh for every occasion,
that we may fill up our stations in the church with propriety and acceptance.
This is a great family, in which are many servants allotted to many different offices;
various work is to be done, and great care is to be taken by every particular servant,
that he diligently minds his own business,
and does not over officiously meddle with that of another;
and in order that confusion may be prevented,
and the Head of the family may not be dishonoured, some servants,
more intimately acquainted with the Master`'s will and with the order of the house,
hold a diligent watch, not only over themselves, but their fellow servants, for good;
exhorting, reproving, informing, reminding, and all with pure disinterested zeal,
seeking not themselves, their own honour and precedence,
but the honour of the great Master,
and the welfare and happiness of every individual in the family.
`'Tis to this service that I want you, my dear friend,
(if Providence should be pleased to grant a renovation of health) to be still more dedicated.
There is a lack of baptized elders among us;
such as have been companions with Christ in his sufferings among us, and by us,
his chosen people.
You see what a host of messengers is sent, even from far distant parts of the earth,
to awaken us to righteousness and amendment of life.
May we, the objects of their visits and of condescending favour, be willing,
yes desirous to go yet deeper down into the sacred pool,
there to be washed from every defilement of spirit, as well as of flesh; that so,
being happily reduced to the little child`'s state,
we may lose "`the wise and prudent,`" in the reduction of self,
and be in a state fit to receive the glorious mysteries of the kingdom,
"`revealed unto babes`" in Christ.

You know upon what grounds, convictions and feelings you came, at the first,
to profess the truth; you know what it has since done for you, how you have espoused it,
and with what company you have on various occasions been engaged in the promotion of it:
and I doubt not you still believe it to be the most inestimable treasure,
which the heart of man is capable of enjoying.
Be honest with yourself, as I hope, my dear friend, you will be,
and try whether you have not suffered loss;
whether for some time past there has not been a decay, instead of an increase,
of divine virtue in your soul:
and whether your ability for service in religious society has not been greatly weakened,
if not entirely lost.
This perhaps your candour and integrity will acknowledge; but self, that partial,
pernicious counsellor, self, will probably plead that loss indeed has been sustained,
but that the fault is not all your own; that you have met with hard usage,
improper treatment, and an unchristian spirit, in dealing, from your brethren:
and that though you may be, in some measure, wrong,
it is evident that they are not altogether right.
This reasoning leads to a self-complacence, and retorting;
which will only bewilder and aggravate.
I would therefore, in true good-will, and cordial desires for your restoration and help,
recommend you, dear friend, as much as possible, to turn out this reasoner,
this interested, prejudiced counsellor, self; to look unto Jesus,
the author of your faith; to lay prostrate as at his feet; to bear his chastisements;
and not only bear, but with all your heart to desire them, as being the stripes,
by which you are to be healed: no, farther, submit yourself with a dutiful,
filial submission to your mother the church,
though some of her children may seem not in the spirit of meekness, but angry with you;
be not moved to retaliate, but remember the pattern which the great Master set us:
as says the apostle, "`For even hereunto were you called,
because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example,
that you should follow his steps: who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:
who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not;
but committed himself to him that judges righteously.`"
How much more then should his followers and disciples,
when they have been overtaken in a fault, confess their frailty, humble themselves,
and make restitution, and satisfaction, and reparation, as far as in their power?
We have seen the danger of persisting in a line of
conduct contrary to the general sense of the brethren,
and of being pertinacious in our own opinions; how it lowers in esteem,
and lays waste the service of those who were gifted and honourable men.
I confess I am afraid lest the enemy of all good should
make use of your present situation and circumstances,
as an engine to batter down any wall of stability and security that is left about you,
and wreak his infernal malice upon you; for "`Hell and destruction are never full.`"
O, may you with full purpose of heart turn to him,
who graciously visited you in early youth,
who gave you a name and inheritance among his people, and who,
if the fault be not your own, will demonstrate that his promises are not yes and no,
but yes and Amen, and that his mercy endures forever.

The national meeting was, I hope, owned in degree in the several sittings of it;
my poor spirit was favoured with being brought low, and plunged into the deeps,
a state I love, because I love cleanliness; and I desire no other state,
nor any other support or food, than what Infinite Wisdom sees fit to administer to me:
he knows our several frames and textures, and what is necessary and best for us;
he is the wise potter, who knows when and how to use the fire and water, to harden,
to soften, and to let the vessel stand in a preparing state for the appointed time:
he is the wise householder, who at his pleasure occupies the vessel when prepared;
yet even then, when he takes it down, cleanses it afresh for use.
May we, in every stage of the operation of his plastick hand, be submissive,
content to remain as on our mouths, turned upside down,
or standing as on the shelf unoccupied,
as well as using all diligence of spirit to be in
a state of readiness for any little use,
which perhaps the Master may suddenly require!
His tried, experienced,
faithful servants with one voice declare that he is the best of masters;
and I am sure this life seems a poor, insipid, paltry round of care and cumber,
vanity and folly, unless it be sweetened,
animated and renewed by the spirit of Christianity entering into and among our feelings;
so, my beloved, go on and prosper in your own little way,
attentive to please the husband of souls, learning of him at home,
simply and honestly doing whatever he bids you;
not too much looking out and musing on what this or that body will say or think,
but cultivating retiredness of spirit, and attending to the gift which is in you:
so be it.

Such is the excellent nature of this holy power,
that the more the gift is exercised (under a lively influence) the brighter it shines,
the stronger it grows, and the more the precious anointing accompanies it.
But unfaithfulness, disobedience, spiritual indolence,
will always gradually work its decay; and then uncomfortableness, unpleasantness,
uneasiness, and indeed unhappiness crowd in from all quarters,
from within and from without; a host of foes,
and our best friend and ally alienated from us.
So, my dear friend, let you and I go on quietly and softly, and feelingly,
in our own little line of life; if we get any little good for ourselves,
let us husband it carefully, the times are poor; but if there seems a redundancy,
let it flow, nor fear to waste the ointment;
and indeed if there should be no super-abundance for ourselves,
if a famine should be in our land, yet should we be glad to handle the holy things,
and of being favoured to distribute to others; for so doing,
we shall certainly get enough to keep life and soul together, and as the times go,
we may be very well satisfied with this,
"`You shall not muzzle the ox which treads out the corn.`"

1st month 1788.

Last night we received yours, of the day preceding,
with an account of the final outcome of your anxieties respecting your beloved infant,
and it is the last and worst to be expected concerning her:
no painful fears about her future conduct;
no danger of her entering into temptation of the enemy: no corruption of the heart,
nor any internal defilement to annoy or destroy; no cares, conflicts,
and embarrassments of this world to vex and perplex her,
no more pain and sorrow of body and mind,
but an admittance into that kingdom which is composed of such;
into one of those mansions prepared by the Father for innocent and sanctified spirits,
which, forever happy in a new state of existence, are doubtless glorified by,
and are employed in glorifying forever, the glorious Author of their being.
Well will it be for us if we can but go to them.
In order to which attainment, we that are continued on this stage,
have a sharp and constant warfare to maintain, not only with flesh and blood,
and that which is inherent in them,
but some of us are called to grapple with and encounter
spiritual wickedness in ourselves and in others;
we have an arduous fight to maintain, and great care, caution, and diligence to exercise;
else, instead of overcoming, we maybe overcome of evil,
and even near the end of the race, may fall and lose the prize.

My beloved, you have received a gift for the edification of your brethren and sisters;
do not despise it nor the occupation of it, but diligently wait on your gift,
and exercise it in the simplicity according to the ability received:
so will you not only grow therein,
but grow in favour with the great master and with his faithful servants:
you will find that humility,
fidelity and obedience will make way for you in the hearts of the people,
and make room for extensive service, to the increase of your peace and tranquillity.
Then, when cross occurrences fall out, and external trials beset,
these things will be received with equanimity and patience;
"`Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?`"
But, on the contrary, where there is a desire to save self and its honour,
a reluctance to expose one`'s self and become vile; or a disqualification for service,
of our own bringing on; then we are not only uncomfortable in ourselves,
retard our own growth, accumulate weakness;
but when disagreeable events are permitted to befall us,
they appear to us clothed with terror, and ministers of divine wrath.
In this view,
I contemplate with satisfaction the account which I had
of your faithfulness in your late province women`'s meeting;
had you returned home under the load of conscious disobedience,
what an aggravation would it have been to your severe trial!
But I trust a placid serenity is the covering of your spirit, and that you have blessed,
and will be enabled often to bless, that hand which mercifully gives,
and as mercifully and wisely takes away, at his pleasure.

I think it a pity that he should be so much confined, but perhaps it may be best;
some confinement causes us to enjoy liberty with a keener relish,
to prize it more highly, and to be more grateful for it,
as well as to endeavour to turn it to the best advantage.
Time and opportunity are precious things, but very unstable and fleeting,
and should be diligently improved.
I suppose you are now confined at home, and not at the general assembly at Limerick.
Yet of so excellent a nature is the holy principle which
we profess as the main spring of our religious movements,
that distance does not always disunite; there may be a great travail,
union and communion of spirit, where there is a bodily separation.

2nd month 17th 1791.

On my return from +++_______+++ I was saluted with your kind epistle.
It was, and is, very grateful to me,
and I shall esteem it a favour to be thought worthy of the
continued fruits of your friendship and little leisure.
There are many cross occurrences which disquiet the mind,
and if Divine Providence should, on the other hand,
cast up some fresh means of consolation and refreshment,
why should not we avail ourselves of his bounty?
A new correspondence, like a new well opened in the course of pilgrimage and dry travel,
may, under the blessing,
and "`by the direction of the lawgiver,`" prove comfortable
and strengthening for the journey.
I often think of you,
and my cogitations about you are attended with sympathy and compassion;
my mind`'s eye views you in the valley of affliction; be not restless,
but remain there the appointed time,
and the Lord is able to make this "`valley of Achor (which is trouble) a door of hope.`"
He can cause the ground of this same affliction to
be productive of the most salutary increase,
so that not only "`Sharon shall be a fold of flocks,`" but even "`the valley of Achor,
a place for herds to lie down in;`" but this happy experience
is for "`my people that have sought me,`" says the Lord.
May you be strengthened then continually to seek the Lord,
who in inscrutable wisdom orders or permits the close trials which sometimes beset us.
I know nothing we can do more likely to benefit ourselves,
and those whose welfare is nearest to our hearts,
than to keep diligently to a holy travail and wrestling
of spirit on our own and their behalf.
Our own prudence and policy often fail,
and the influence of nature itself loses its sway,
where it has all right to rule and govern;
but even the king`'s heart is in the hand of the Lord,
as "`the rivers of waters he turns it whithersoever he will.`"
I was pleased to hear you were out on church service.
I am persuaded that no worldly business detains you
at home with the consent of your will:
and I doubt not but it is (as it certainly ought
to be) your studious endeavour to get your head,
hands and feet (as I believe your heart is already) loose,
and become more and more the Lord`'s freeman.
Remember the call, "`Shake yourself (not only from the grosser and more defiling part,
but) from the dust, O, Jerusalem;`" and loose yourself "`From the bands of your neck, O,
captive daughter of Zion:`" then will there be a
putting on strength and the beautiful garments;
then will there be a receiving the gift in perfection,
and exercising it to the honour of the Giver,
as well as to consequent sweetness and peace;
then precious virtue is known to go forth from the Holy One,
as through the vehicle of a refined and purified spirit, to others;
and there is a rejoicing together in the great Master`'s name.
Thus will you more and more rise in the dominion of Truth, and get, in your mind,
over all those things which would agitate, and annoy,
and turn aside from the proper centre.
Thus, however useful you may have been in civil and religious life, your last days will,
by the increase of living sap, be your best days; your end will be happy,
and your example live in sweet memorial among future generations.
So be it!--says your truly affectionate faithful friend.

Your letter seemed to congratulate us on the return of our dear friend Sarah Grubb;
but see what state of existence we are in, how transient and uncertain.
She just got to our national meeting to deliver up her certificate,
gave a short simple account of their visit to the continent,
spoke as if herself had been nothing and had done nothing,
magnified her Master`'s cause in several sittings of the meeting; went to her own home,
and saluted her relations and friends there;
proceeded to the quarterly meeting to which she belonged, at Cork,
laboured there in the authority of the gospel, and when it was over,
laid down her head in peace at our friend Samuel Neale`'s house, at Spring Mount,
8th of 12th month last.
Her loss, as a member both of civil and religious society, is very much regretted:
but encomiums are superfluous. If we revere her character,
let us endeavour to follow her example;
if we are attached to the cause which she was so eminently engaged in,
let us wait for qualifications to support it,
according to our several measures and stations.

+++______+++ hears now and then from the neighbouring continent,
and favours us with some account.
We understand the precious seed sown there does not seem to be lost;
we rather hope that it has taken root and is springing up;
perhaps "`The earth is helping the woman:`" the convulsions and revolutions
in that country forwarding the establishment of the church of Christ.

I am now I see got near the end of my paper,
and I feel my love to you all abound and spread;
but have not left myself room to write it down:
among others +++_______+++ (if still on this side of heaven)
possesses my affectionate remembrance.

9th month 4th, 1791.

Remembering that I was in your epistolary debt,
believe I should have written to you of my being favoured to get well home,
etc. but having been longer in debt to your sister
+++_______+++ I thought best to pay off that score,
and hope she communicated any intelligence that was worth imparting to you.
I hope also, that the event of a personal interview is no interruption,
but rather a cement of our correspondence.
I have just been re-perusing your last kind letter, with renewed satisfaction,
and wish to be preserved in such a humble state as
to keep the unity and much valued amity of such friends:
indeed much depends on being preserved in this state,
so characteristic of the great Master.
A departure from it has proved the ruin of thousands;
and by how much more useful and conspicuous any become in the church,
so much more conspicuous should this spirit appear in them.

This spirit, if kept to, will work wonders; it is the well watered,
well dug and well cultivated soil, in which the Christian virtues grow and nourish.
Alas!--for many in our poor society, they have chosen the barren mountains,
a dry and parched soil; their roots have struck into a hard stiff clay,
and they bear neither leaves nor fruit.
But the great Husbandman is not unmindful of his plantation,
he is sending skilful labourers into it; and not only so,
but by his own immediate power he has reached many, arrested them in their retrograde,
wayward course, and brought them into the way everlasting.
So that,
(according to my sense) there is encouragement for
the faithful devoted servants to persevere;
doing each his own business, and that part of the general labour which is assigned him.
Some individuals may be sent on particular expeditions and services;
but the discipline of the church is a general field of labour,
in which no living member is exempt from a share.

For my part, ever since I became, in some measure, acquainted with the Truth,
and mercifully arrived at some settlement in it, my relative duties in religious society,
and the share in the support of discipline, which I apprehended fell to my lot,
have been among the capital weights and burdens, and exercises, and distresses,
of my life.
As our inward frames differ one from another,
so these things are harder to some dispositions than others.
They have been particularly so to me; so that I could say with Job,
"`The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful food.`"
But I have lived to see a termination of many of these conflicts;
I have lived to see captivity led captive; rebellious children become loyal subjects;
and the opposers of truth triumphantly bearing its standard in the sight of its enemies,
their former associates.
Many unfaithful professors also, whom neither gentle expostulations could win,
nor repeated warnings intimidate,
have been summoned before another tribunal to receive
their final sentence and everlasting retribution,
according as their works have been.
O that such as now trouble the church may awake in time,
to a proper sense of their state, before it be too late,
while the day of visitation lasts, and a place of repentance is yet to be found; for,
by reason of frequent resistance, there may be a cessation of the strivings of grace,
and the poor creature, left to itself in the hour of bitter distress,
may seek and ask in vain.

I had the favour of a letter, some time ago, from our mutual dear friend;
he was expecting to sail shortly in the Pigou.
His letter was fraught with a precious cargo of love,
which he commissioned me in a particular manner to distribute;
it would be a valuable commission, if capacity to fulfill it were also added;
like a large cargo of guineas sent from the king`'s mint for circulation,
which enriches the person to whom it is delegated with "`Dust of Gold.`"

Perhaps you will let me know if there be anything
new respecting our friends on the neighbouring continent,
or any other matters relative to the prosperity of the most interesting cause existing,
or which ever existed, or ever will exist upon earth.

My dear friends at +++_______+++,
I know kindly interest themselves in the welfare of me and mine.
Be so kind as to inform them,
that we are generally favoured with health and tranquillity here.

Letter 43.

[.signed-section-context-open]
8th month 3rd, 1792.

I doubt not but that our beloved sister acknowledged
for me the receipt of your acceptable letter;
it conveyed the sorrowful intelligence of the removal of our mutual dear friend+++_________+++,
and this goes charged with an account of the translation
of another precious servant from works to rewards.
Our well-esteemed friend and brother Samuel Neale,
had of late years been rather on the decline,
and these last three or four months grew much worse;
was seized with a mortification in his foot,
and notwithstanding all the medical skill and labour bestowed,
departed this life 27th ult.
His head had been much affected and his thoughts confused
by the opiates which it was judged proper to give him;
but at intervals of recollection and clear understanding,
he put forth the evident sweet and savoury fruits of a sound mind;
of a mind supported by divine effectual help,
which enabled and authorised him feelingly to express triumph over death,
hell and the grave.

His travels in all parts of the world where our religious society was settled,
at one time or other of his life, caused him to be very generally known,
and the sweetness, liveliness, and tenderness which accompanied his gospel labours,
made him very generally beloved; so that it may be said of this Samuel also, "`He died,
and all Israel lamented him.`"
My youngest child, Sarah, had for a long time been attached to him;
with our free consent she was much gratified by an assiduous
attendance on her honoured friend for several weeks past,
and was present with him, to her comfort, at the final close.
Thus "`The righteous perishes;`" but I hope it cannot
be said that "`No man lays it to heart.`"
I trust these dispensations to the church, ordered in infinite wisdom,
are laid to heart by many of our youth especially;
and that there will be a succession of fishers, and fowlers, and hunters,
who will diligently seek after, and preserve alive,
the precious prey of the souls of men.

I observe that when you favoured me with your last, you were on the eve of a journey:
I hope it proved prosperous, that peace was the effect and the reward,
am glad when I hear of your excursions in the service of truth:
such exercise strengthens the spiritual constitution,
and the example of those whom Providence has been pleased
not only to endow but to bless with even this world`'s affluence,
has a powerful influence.
Of how much greater weight and use must it be,
when spiritual gifts are added to temporal loans?
Bear with me, dear friend,
and do not refuse the word of approbation and encouragement when it comes rightly to you,
or at least from a well meaning-spring: trouble and discouragement are plentiful enough.

You rich men are really to be pitied, and demand the cordial sympathy of your friends.
I am thankful that there are a few of you who bid fair for escaping the woe,
and entering the kingdom,
though it may be through great tribulations and afflictions of various kinds.
`'Tis but holding out a little longer,
and the scene of probation and conflict will be over with us all;
then our spirits shall center in the mansions prepared for them.
But our example may operate long after our existence here; as is said,
"`He being dead yet speaks.`"
May the cause therefore of Truth, and its precious testimonies,
ever be dearer and nearer to us than any other consideration; and let us,
like faithful Abraham, (the friend of God) in our heart and will,
sacrifice every natural feeling and affection to that allegiance which
we owe to the supreme command and good pleasure of our great Creator,
manifested to us by the spirit of his Son;
this appears to be the most likely means to draw
down the favour and friendship of heaven upon us,
and to preserve in us a better and happier state; in that in which we have,
under a sense of duty, offered in our hearts a sacrifice to the Lord.

Your sister favoured my daughter with a letter not long,
advising of her and being outward bound; I heartily wish them good speed;
they are taking the high road to heaven; thus diligently exercising their gifts,
and having it as their food and drink to do the will of him who sent them.
My best love follows them wherever they go,
and I wish myself and family to be remembered by them for good.

I hope our mutual friend is well; her retreat from was, no doubt, melancholy,
and she has intimately felt the loss of her precious friend and companion; but I trust,
the cup of mourning has been sweetened to her taste
by the union and fellowship which death cannot divide.
I am obliged by your information respecting friends returned to America, etc.
Shall always be obliged by any new material intelligence concerning the affairs of truth,
on that, or this neighbouring continent.
Remember me affectionately to my dear friends.

I feel unity with the meeting`'s renewed labour with +++_______+++. O
what an element is divine love! In this the children of the light,
live, and breathe, and move, and act; there is no infection here, it is clear, pure,
and salutary.
I should be glad that the poor man might be effectually conquered;
you are dear to me for having so followed, and been so guided in service,
as to be instrumental of good in his case.
Your prayers and your alms-deeds, that is, your secret wrestlings of spirit,
and your private labours and communications will, no doubt, come up in memorial.

I expect you know that I received yours of the 5th of last month.
the contents are such as this state of existence often affords:
we have indeed a cup of mixture to partake of:
but then it is wisely mixed and tempered by the great hand; it is not for us poor, blind,
and ignorant creatures to say, What are you doing?
--but patiently to submit and bow in humble submission,
and in a persuasion that the Judge of all the earth does right.
It is glad tidings to me that you are getting on so well, and no doubt,
cause of humiliation and gratitude to you both that the arm of everlasting
strength has been experienced in such renewed and effectual support:
there is great encouragement in this to proceed in the track of revealed duty.
Many have hurt themselves, and become lame and dwarfish all their lives long,
by letting in the reasoner and discourager: consulting human prudence and propriety;
limiting the spirit, which is the Holy One; starting aside from services,
like an affrighted horse on the road; and being in great fear where no fear is.
But you, beloved friend,
seem to have got out of the narrow ways and crooked paths on to the high road for travellers,
leading to the city of the Great King; and by continuing diligent, faithful, and devoted,
you will know more and more distinctly the Master`'s will,
and be strengthened to perform it.
Thus, if it be consistent with infinite wisdom to prolong your life here,
you will be happy in yourself and useful in the creation of God;
and if a short warning should summon you from this conflicting state, you are prepared,
you have nothing to do but to die; this mortal to put on immortality;
your sorrows here to be changed into unmixed everlasting joy;
and your example and memorial will live and preach to succeeding generations.

Alas I am a poor weak creature, much more fit to be ministered to,
than qualified to minister to another:
yet I was quite willing to do what I was made able to do, that is, to pray for you.
I am glad that you are on service; it`'s the way for you to grow strong,
and to get above the little glooms and recurring perplexities which, from various causes,
cast down and disquiet the soul.
By being thus employed and accustomed to exercise, you will become a trained servant,
and be made capable to instruct others, your fellow servants,
in the duties of their places and stations;
feeding not only the lambs but the sheep of Christ.

Go on then, my dear friend; be not afraid of the face of man,
nor ashamed of the cross of Christ.
I repeat, as I have often said, that nothing more glorious, more dignifying,
more beneficial to mankind,
or more worthy of the dedication of all our faculties to espouse and promote,
was ever let down from heaven to earth.
Not only true civilization of manners and sound morality,
but life and immortality (that is immortal life) and eternal salvation,
are made manifest through the gospel.
A dispensation of which, I doubt not, is committed to you, in order to advance,
according to your gift and measure, these glorious ends.

I doubt not you esteem it a favour from on high to be engaged, in the least degree,
in the Lord`'s service.
May you always keep here; low, humble,
thankful for any scraps which may fall from the altar, about which you minister.
Oh, this humility!
When shall I cease from inculcating the necessity of it
to those I love! or from praying to be preserved in it myself;
I am sensible, that though I should preach to others, without keeping on this bottom,
I may become a castaway from divine favour.

I note your general silence in public assemblies; I trust you are, in a good degree,
a living witness of the sufferings of Christ, who was oppressed, afflicted,
yet opened not his mouth!
To lose our own wills in the will of the Great Master, is the top stone of the building;
then servants are in a state fit to receive orders,
then the master is pleased to instruct them,
and they are ready and willing to go on his errands;
they take the message clearly and deliver it clearly;
it carries conviction along with it, and the work is blessed in their hands.

Notwithstanding the reports of the vessel being wrecked,

Yet a well-grounded hope remains, that,
that part in them which is out of the power of the elements of nature, has been,
and forever will be,
the object of divine preservation and everlasting salvation! `'Tis true,
the manner and circumstances of their dissolution, appears dreadful to us! but perhaps,
on the whole,
not attended with greater pain to them than if they had died in the arms of their friends.
Death is generally accompanied with something terrifying to human nature:
a lingering death is also replete with much pain of body;
this our friends were exempt from, though it is very probable,
for some hours they felt the horrors of their dreadful situation.
They have shot the gulf the last pinching agony is over with them!
Now their near relations and the surviving friends are the
subjects of our deep sympathy and tender compassion:
may the Lord comfort and sustain them,
and afford an adequate supply from his inexhaustible treasury!
He has a remedy competent to every evil,
and no depth of distress is out of the reach of his merciful relief.

nor to be deficient in such visible token of friendship as is in my power to give.
I therefore take this opportunity of expressing my
joint concern with yours for our common loss;
a loss severely felt throughout the borders of our religious society in these nations,
where the report has yet spread, and is attended with peculiar regret.
For as love begets love, that spirit of charity, benevolence,
and brotherly kindness which so conspicuously influenced
the disposition of this good man,
did not fail to produce reciprocal affection towards him in others.
We lament the steady, upright friend; the pleasing, instructive companion;
the lively experienced minister; the diligent, faithful labourer,
removed from among us.
His family,
who more particularly partook of the pleasure and profit
arising from such good qualities and qualifications,
must doubtless, deeply feel the privation:
but this sorrow will (I trust) be so tempered with resignation to the divine will,
and so mingled with a comfortable hope of the happy end of the dear deceased,
that there will ensue a quiet composure of mind, and sweet unity with his spirit,
safely centered in its holy rest.--What remains for us is,
so to pass the short uncertain time of our sojourning here, as that we,
at the close of all, may join the spirits of the blessed,
never more to be separated from them.
Human nature recoils with horror at the idea of everlasting
exclusion from heaven and happiness,
in the regions of woe and misery.
And yet, if we would on any reasonable grounds expect to die the death of the righteous,
and that our latter end should be like unto his,
we must use all diligent endeavours to live the life of the righteous,
that we may obtain at last the glorious prize,
and not most unhappily miss so great salvation.
Religious parents, devoted as your dear father-in-law was to the service of truth,
and indefatigable in his labours for the good of others,
not only purchase a blessed inheritance for themselves, but often for their successors:
their pains, their prayers, their secret offerings, rise in sweet memorial,
and their children and families inherit the benefit thereof; such,
I hope and believe will (through infinite mercy) be the happy experience
of most of the nearest relations of my dear friend;
and some of the branches of this valuable stock, abiding the purging seasons,
and submitting to the forming and turning of the divine hand,
will bear fruit grateful to God and man.
With these my spirit has unity;
and I earnestly desire their preservation and perseverance in that holy path,
into which the feet of their minds have been turned;
that they in their day may be useful and honourable
living members of the church of Christ,
and that there may be a succession of testimony-bearers to that truth which was first,
and will stand last upon earth.
But should any of the visited children of a visited family,
the offspring of religious parents, who have watched over them with tender attention,
and often admonished them for their good;
should any of these turn from the grace of God into licentiousness,
trample upon his witness in their consciences,
reject the calls and invitations of his spirit,
and set at nought their birthright and education, surely dangerous is their situation;
they are running giddily (as it were,) on the edge of a dreadful precipice,
and dallying with their destruction.
With all my heart I wish that the youth among us were
properly sensible of the magnitude of the danger of slighting,
and neglecting to cultivate, the merciful visitations of heaven.
That which in mercy was extended as a shepherd`'s crook to draw them,
and help them along, will, if despised and let go, prove as an iron rod;
the same sun which in the visible creation, cheers and invigorates the living,
accelerates the putrefaction of the dead.
"`As they did not like (says the apostle) to retain God in their
knowledge,`" (which implies that they had once known him,
and been visited by him) "`God gave them over to a reprobate mind,
to do those things which are not convenient;`" and then
follows a catalogue disgraceful not only to Christianity,
but to humanity itself.
O! May those children of my honoured friend,
who from their local situation are more exposed to
evil than those hopeful plants of the same house,
who have partaken more of parental care and nurture; may those,
though they may have wandered as into a far country,
and fed on polluted and unsubstantial food,
be favoured with a fresh visitation and recollection where they are,
and from where they have strayed; be minded to return to their heavenly Father`'s house,
and experience the arms of mercy stretched forth in great condescension to receive them,
before it be too late, and the door be finally shut.

19th of 2nd month 1771.

I confess it looks hardly decent in me to make no return of this
sort to two obliging letters which I have had from you.
You enquire concerning my father`'s health;
he has had several attacks of (what is called) a bilious cholic;
we were much concerned about him,
but (through favour of good Providence) he has recruited finely; however,
his hardly allowing himself to be taken proper care of,
subjects him to the danger of a return of his disorder,
and us to frequent fears respecting him;
manifold indeed is the loss we shall sustain by the translation of my venerable father;
but the loss of his weighty spirit, exemplary life,
and lively services in our poor destitute society, would be most of all to be lamented.
A cause, dear friend, worthy the attachment of the most dignified natures;
a mystery so glorious, that even angels have desired to pry into it.
Christianity in its purity,
undefiled with the mixture of worldly wisdom and superstitious ceremonies,
has been revealed from heaven to our ancestors.
They nobly stood by it, and faithfully kept that which was committed to their trust:
they have rested from their labours here,
and are now in the full possession of the fruits of these labours, even life eternal.
There still remains the same cause to be supported in our generation;
the same conflict to be maintained with the grand adversary of our happiness,
and the corruptions of our fallen nature; the same and only effectual means of victory;
and the same immortal crown at the end for him that overcomes.
But where are now the combatants?
The multitude professing to walk in the way of truth, are not in the way;
they are not spiritually minded; they mind their own things, not the things of God;
hence a general indifference, as to the life and virtue of religion,
has overspread us as a leprosy;
our minds are not in a state prepared for that fellowship with the divine spirit,
in which consists the happiness both of men and angels.
Those gifts and graces which the Father of Lights and Spirits
would pour out upon the living members of his church,
are withheld, and the shame of our nakedness is visible, even to them that are without.
Think of this, beloved friend, and let sorrow seize your heart,
because these things are so.
Open your heart to the convictions and judgments which are the
preparatory dispensation to the reception of pure and unmixed good.
"`Open your doors, O Lebanon, and let the fire consume your cedars!`"
If I am not mistaken, you are not altogether unacquainted with this work.
You have felt something of the corroding smart of judgment for evil;
you have felt the gentle drawings and invitations of the spirit,
alluring you out of the friendship and familiarity of the world,
and offering you a "`place and a name in the Lord`'s house and within his walls,
better than of sons and of daughters.`"
You have seen and felt the instability and uncertainty
of the nearest and dearest temporal enjoyments;
and the great vacuum, the inanity,
the insufficiency of worldly gratifications to satisfy
the aspirations and longings of an immortal soul,
have at times been opened to your understanding and view.
May you, dear friend, ponder deeply where you are; and whether you have, in a noble,
unreserved dedication of all, obeyed the heavenly vision.
Whether we seek great things for ourselves or not, our time passes quickly over,
our places here will soon know us no more,
and the Lord is determined to bring this evil (of death) upon all flesh,
and that wonderful fabric of our bodies, which he has made, will he break down.
Happy will it then be for those, who,
their lives being spent here in humble circumspect walking,
and the service of the best of masters, will have it said to them individually,
"`Well done, good and faithful servant, enter into the joy of your Lord.`"

Excuse this freedom which I have taken on this solemn subject;
a consciousness of my hearty desires for your welfare, emboldens me to use it.

Letter 50.

By a letter I have just now received from your nephew, I am informed of your great loss.
Lack of earlier information renders it difficult for me to attend the solemnity,
which is to be on that occasion tomorrow, were there not other impediments in my way.
As I could not conveniently pay that mark of friendship,
I therefore thought of sending you a few lines, expressive of my condolence and sympathy.

The pleasing disposition and engaging manners of the dear deceased,
endeared her (no doubt) to many others, as well as to my wife and me;
but a secret something united us to her in a close, and intimate, and feeling relation.

We loved her as a near and dear friend.
She is now released from those long infirmities,
which infinite wisdom permitted her to pass through,
for the trial of her faith and patience,
and for her preparation for an admittance into that
holy rest which nothing impure can enter.
Refined and polished while here for the company of blessed spirits,
she is (I doubt not) mingled in their happy society.
We remain a little longer to struggle with the difficulties
and encounter the temptations which belong to this life.
We are not yet putting off our harness, therefore have no reason to boast,
but to dwell in awful fear.
We are, some of us, the heads of families, principal persons in our places;
our precepts and our example therefore must have considerable weight and influence.
How necessary is it for us then to ask wisdom of him,
who gives liberally and upbraids not!--that by rightly fulfilling
all our several duties in our families and in the church,
we may, as we pass along in our journey, from time to time,
have the answer in our consciences, of "`well done good and faithful servant,
enter into the joy of your Lord,`" as well as that
happy sentence at the close of this visible scene.

My mind, while I am thus engaged,
is turned with tender solicitude towards your beloved offspring;
I believe that many of them (and most probably all of them)
have felt the gentle touches of the divine hand,
and the invitations of the good spirit, in the secret of their souls;
drawing them from the spirit of the world, in its manifold appearances and shapes,
and begetting in them desires and aspirations after enduring substance.
May they with all diligence cultivate the renewal of these tendering impressions,
and in all humility submit to the operation of these cleansing baptisms,
which purify the heart, and make it a fit receptacle for unmixed good.
A gracious Providence has not been lacking in his
precious visitations to the youth among us;
but there has been a great lack in them,
of following on to know the Lord in the renewed experience of his humbling power,
and in the further manifestations of his will concerning them.
Hence the goodness of too many of them is but like the morning cloud and early dew;
it is soon superseded by a relish for the pomps and vanities of this world,
and their baptismal vows are soon forgotten;
and hence a lack of succession of testimony-bearers to the noblest cause, which ever did,
or ever will, dignify human nature.
I particularly wish for the elder branches of your numerous, hopeful stock,
that as now a greater charge devolves upon them,
they may seek and wait for heavenly wisdom to direct their own steps,
and influence every part of their conduct;
that so they may grow in favour with their great Creator,
and in his hand be made a blessing to the younger branches of the family,
assisting to train them up, by example and precept, in the life of religion,
and in that plainness and simplicity which adorn our holy profession.

Letter 51.

Our meetings of discipline were held this week at Carlow.
There seemed to appear some good fruits of the manifold labours taken lately;
and also sorrowful cause of apprehension, lest, in some, the good seed then sown,
may have, in great measure, been picked out again.
However, these things must be left; those who are sent to plant and water,
faithfully doing their duty, are clear;
the consequential increase is of the Lord of the harvest.
Indeed, in this instrumental labour, there is great need of skill, and we are poor,
blind, fallible creatures.
What must we do then that feel ourselves called to labour in our various departments?
Ask counsel of God, be diligent in his business, and fervent in our spirits;
earnestly desiring that he may keep our feet when we officiate in his house,
lest following (through ignorance and mistake,
not willing intention) the leadings of the imagination, and that which is natural,
we gradually and insensibly lose sight of the spiritual guide, and the grand enemy,
ever restless and on the watch, even among the assemblies of the sons of God,
working in the mystery,
prevail to substitute some mixture of the creature in the place of the true light.
In such case, when the mind of the minister, in the exercise of his gift,
is impressed with some little fear or jealousy,
lest the right guide is disappearing and the imagination, the natural part,
is taking its place, I believe it is best to pause, to recollect,
to endeavour to let the flutter and commotion subside, to be still,
and wait to know what is of God; and accordingly,
as the Holy Evidence speaks peace or otherwise, in this silence of all flesh, proceed,
or desist, always bearing in mind, that too little said, may often be supplied;
but too much can hardly be remedied,

I doubt not, my dear friend,
that you have long anticipated me in reflections and observations of this sort,
though I thus indulge an unpremeditated freedom of dropping what unexpectedly occurs.
I shall be sorry to give you pain or uneasiness, which is far from my intention,
for I have, according to my small measure of feeling, true unity with you,
and cordial brotherly affection with you; but, as we are beset on every side with danger,
a hint or caution, as from one child to another, may at times do no harm;
and I think I know so well your honest, humble heart,
that you will take this in good part, though from a brother of a lower degree;
for though the whetstone itself cannot cut yet it
is of use to sharpen the iron which can cut.

I suppose you have heard long before,
or I would be cautious of being the messenger to you,
of the decease of our dearly beloved friend and elder brother in the truth, William Hunt,
who departed this life at Newcastle, after his return out of Holland.
The instrument employed for his release, from works to rewards, was the small pox.
His companion, I understand, not having had that disorder,
dared not approach him in his illness, which was short.
Who can but feel for his tender weakly wife and numerous
family of children!--so far distant indeed,
but still only on another spot of the Lord`'s footstool, and doubtless,
if the fault be not their own, objects of his peculiar notice and protection.
You may remember at the opportunity which was in +++______+++`'s parlour,
at the time of last Province meeting at +++______+++ with what baptizing
power the dear man spoke concerning some then present,
who would soon be released from their deep and bitter baptisms,
and received into a glorious place of reward:
very probably the testimony might in part belong to himself.
The great Controller of events knows what is best for all, and each of us;
and to his ordering we must submit.
A little time numbers us too, that survive, to the silent grave; happy for us,
if by keeping near the appointed means of help (the all-sufficient grace of God),
we may be enabled to fill up our several duties here,
so as to obtain a place of rest and everlasting repose
for our weary tribulated spirits hereafter.

Letter 52.

I received your last and attended to the contents with a mind impressed with sorrow;
indeed sorrow and trouble are at times spread before me,
on account of the situation of things in our religious society.
What is the reason that many educated among us,
should be such enemies to the truth they profess?
Yes, the bitterness and enmity of their spirits (like thick darkness) is to be felt.
What must be opposed to those fiery darts?
For my part,
I know nothing more likely for the honest-hearted
to defend themselves and preserve their own spirits,
nor to overcome the agents of the wicked one withal, than the power of gospel-love.
This, if deeply and patiently kept to, will work wonders; this is invincible,
and it`'s armour impenetrable.
But if this be in any measure departed from,
or adulterated with self-love (which is the parent of resentment),
it causes a breach in the panoply (the whole armour) of God, who is love,
and so leaves some weak part unguarded to be wounded and hurt.
If any therefore have been injured or hurt in this way,
to a deep and steady search after the healing virtue of divine love,
I would earnestly recommend them: and as this becomes operative,
and predominant in the mind, it will influence to say, and do these things,
and these only, which make for peace; and I am in the belief, that if patiently kept to,
it will bear down all before it, and, in due time possess the gates of it`'s enemies.

Letter 53.

I am glad that you meet with that respect and attention which may, in some measure,
compensate the loss of domestic endearments.
Indeed there was hardly a doubt but this tribute would be paid you.
People of good breeding and good sense would hardly be deficient in this respect.
On your part I am persuaded your faculties are exerted to manifest
that you are not undeserving of the marks of friendship shown you.
A liberal mind is grateful to a high degree;
and this contention between benefits and gratitude has something very noble in it.
You strives, my dear friend, I doubt not, to be accomplished in a still superior style,
in order for your own improvement, and for a capacity to acquit yourself,
in your station, with greater eclat; for this purpose you read, you write, you converse:
but, here it seems to me that a danger may attend.

Accumulated knowledge is apt to puff up,
and that beautiful simplicity of manners into which truth leads,
may be unhappily departed from.
The world has its own customs, and also its own language and terms; delicacy,
politeness, refinement, sentiment, are capital words in its vocabulary,
but of very equivocal meaning:
the spirit of the world is utterly wrong and in direct
opposition to the spirit of genuine Christianity,
as the new Testament abundantly everywhere testifies.
The possession of the qualities implied in those terms, even in their fairest sense,
the treasure of literary acquisitions and polite accomplishments,
however useful in their places, are not the essential good,
are not the one thing absolutely needful, "`That good part`" which the Master,
who knew the heart, knew that "`Mary had chosen.`"
and was graciously pleased, for her encouragement, to promise,
that "`it should not be taken from her.`"
May you, my dear friend also, in your day and sphere of action, surrender your heart,
so to be mollified and modelled by the Master`'s power, so made clean and right,
that he may view it with acceptance and approbation; thus the fountain being made good,
and kept with all diligence, out of it are witnessed to flow, the issues of life:
the natural and improved qualifications being sanctified,
and the spiritual gifts super-added, human nature arrives at its perfection;
man then is made (but) little lower than the angels, being crowned with glory and honour.
This is what is held out to us, the prize most worthy to be contended for,
the favour of God, infinitely preferable to the favour of vain unstable man.
Well deserving our attention is that saying of our Lord.
"`You are they which justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts;
for that which is highly esteemed among men, is abomination in the sight of God.`"

Letter 54.

You have been of late so much the companion of my thoughts,
and the subject of my good desires, that it has weighed with me,
whether it be not a kind of duty for me to write to you.
I hope I am not very forward to write or speak about the most solemn
things in a cursory way (and my own stock is so small,
that I would not, willingly,
be lavish of it unnecessarily,) but where can be the harm
of sometimes communicating one`'s feelings with a friend,
and stirring up the pure mind by way of remembrance of those things,
which the hurry and cumber of this world,
the inattention and distraction of our thoughts, the depravity of our nature,
the allurement of our passions,
and the workings of a potent insidious adversary upon them,
are too apt to detach us from, and cause us too frequently to forget.-- I love you,
dear friend, and your father`'s house, with a sincere affection.
I wish you all the blessings and comforts of this life, and a better life;
and from those sensations which, in my hours of retirement, I have found in my own mind.
I believe, that the good will of heaven flows in a strong current towards you:
may nothing in any of you divert or check its progress.
It will qualify your spirits for the enjoyment of
the goods of this life with the most grateful relish;
it will support you to bear the evils of it with the noblest fortitude,
and will finally conduct you (if you leave yourselves to be conducted
by it) into the regions of unmixed and everlasting happiness.
This precious favour is indeed universal in its extent and operation;
but has more powerful effect and more general influence
upon those who receive and believe in it,
who are living witnesses of its virtue and efficacy;
waiting continually for the fresh supplies of it,
to enable them to discharge a conscience void of offence towards God and man.

Among these too, this holy principle of saving grace,
often operates with peculiar force on the minds of such as are, as it were,
in the spring of life.
It is the seed time, which, if well improved,
will be succeeded by the warm beams of divine favour,
and the harvest will be to present advantage, as well as to everlasting life.
As I doubt not, dear friend,
of your having been thus visited in the early part of your days,
from an intention of gracious Providence to pre-engage your
affections to himself and the cause of his blessed truth,
before the world, its spirit and its connections should engross you in mature age.
I am earnest, that the living sense of good, begotten in your heart, may not perish,
as in the womb of formation; but nourished by divine virtue, may grow,
and in the fulness of time, be brought forth to the praise of God,
the edification of others, and the great consolation of your own soul.
But allow me, dear friend, to say, a little thing hurts that which is young and tender,
the very jots and tittles of the law and the testimony of Jesus are to be maintained,
or the whole bond of his peace is broken.
He that is not faithful in the little, will not be made ruler over much.
That line is to be preserved inviolable, which divides the children of the kingdom,
from the children of this world; their language, their manners, their aspect,
their outward demeanour and habit, as their country, is different.
It has seemed fitting to infinite wisdom to characterize his people by visible marks,
and I am bold to say,
they will never prosper in true religion according
to the extent of his gracious designs upon them,
who violate those marks of distinction and respect.
The Nazarite is known not only by his temperance, but his exterior appearance.

8th of 1st month 1787.

I received your sundry letters,
and gave all the attention which was likely to be paid by
a feeling and interested friendship to their various contents.
I expected to have written from Waterford, to my dear friend, your afflicted sister,
but I could not compass it, though I repeatedly tried for it; however,
I did you all justice in another way;
I hope sympathy of the best kind was experienced by me while I was there.
That tender sympathy, which, in the mystery of spiritual unity,
helps to bear the infirmities of our beloved friends,
and ministers strength and consolation to them in the hidden life;
that sympathy in which fresh and earnest petitions are secretly put up to Him,
who sees and knows the deep and pungent distress
of his poor creatures from various causes:
and who only can, effectually, relieve them.
Indeed, my dear friend,
many and various are the distresses of our fellow creatures of the human species;
and I love to feel for them and with them,
though I am not at all personally acquainted with them.
Mankind is at all times very near my heart, and I think it alien from humanity,
as well as Christianity, to be insensible to the sufferings of any.
Your beloved sister`'s trouble is great indeed, her trial is acute and poignant,
but if she compares it with the calamities, the pains, the embarrassments,
the distresses of body and mind, which many labour under,
without experiencing proper care, pity, or assistance;--multitudes, like poor Lazarus,
oppressed with poverty and disease, and numbers like the rich man,
in a still worse condition, living as without God in this world,
and just about entering into the everlasting torments of the next;
if she compares her situation with these,
how great is the balance of gratitude on her side of the account.
Many are the considerations and circumstances which preponderate
in favour of a humble patient resignation to the divine will;
this sweet child was removed in innocence,
she has escaped the dangers and temptations of this stage of existence:
she has escaped the horrors of eternal misery;
her pure spirit (we have cause to believe) is forever centered in uninterrupted joy.
She was taken off,
not by her parents bringing a disorder upon her when in perfect health,
but by the visitation of sickness, brought on, or permitted, by Him,
who bears rule on earth as well as in heaven, and does all things right and well.
If it had been consistent with infinite wisdom,
that the sweet babe should have continued longer in this life,
and that it`'s near connections should not have had this grievous affliction,
Omnipotence, no doubt, would have ordered accordingly,
and the present dispensation would not have been at all allotted to you.
Or if it had been consistent with the same wisdom
that the chastisement should have been less severe,
the same power could have prevented those circumstances from attending,
which embitter the sensations arising from this sorrowful event; so,
on looking every way at it, there appears nothing remaining,
but in a child-like state submissively to kiss the rod,
and patiently resign to the divine will.
And that this may be your happy experience, is my sincere desire;
that whether the Lord Almighty gives, or withholds, or takes away,
his name may be blessed and sanctified among you.

23rd of 1st month 1763.

When I am led to believe that our forefathers, in the last century,
were called to hold forth again in their lives and principles that most holy faith,
(even Christianity in its purity) which Christ Jesus taught to his immediate followers,
and established on earth, to remain to the end of the world;
when I ponder that we are the successors in the same faith of those dignified ancestors,
and illustrious sons of the morning of our day,
and that the same cause is now committed to us,
to be maintained in the same spirit and by the same power: I say,
when these things are brought under my solid reflection, I am, at times,
weighed down under a sense of the awful station I am placed in by the wisdom of Providence,
even to be a professor of this religion of Christ; so that I am ready to say,
"`How dreadful is this place.`"
If then it is so awful a matter to profess this holy religion,
as a private member of society,
how much more so must it be to be set apart as a chosen
vessel to convey the quickening virtue of it to others?
How great degrees of purity and holiness are requisite here,
not only in a private capacity to be enabled to set an example of performing the will,
but also in public and private to declare the whole counsel of God?
These have not only the temptations to grapple with,
which are incident to all in general;
but as they are of particular use in carrying on this glorious work,
the grand opposer of it plays his engines in a particular manner against them,
and forms schemes deeply laid, in the mysteries of iniquity,
that if he cannot utterly destroy their faith,
he may render them less useful than infinite wisdom intended, and rob them, in some part,
of the weight of their present and future crown,
and the church of the benefits which might accrue from the
perfections of the gifts and graces bestowed upon them,
it is this enemy`'s grand employment, dear friend,
to be constantly endeavouring to defile the vessel,
through which the divine intelligence is at times communicated to the people,
and divine life conveyed; for there is no other excellence required in the instrument,
but that it be clear and clean.
It seems to me as though he had principally three
ways by which he strives to effect this purpose.
First, he would so hurt the vessel, or pipe,
as that none at all of this precious liquor should enter it:
but that which once was a vessel of honour should be laid aside as useless.

Secondly, there, is danger lest the vessel,
though in a good measure clean and free from filth of any kind,
for lack of being sufficiently imbued with the savour
of the liquor passing often enough through it,
should impregnate and adulterate the liquor with some quality inherent in,
or accidental to, the vessel itself.
And, lastly, the pipe may be polluted by the sediments of this same precious liquor,
which should be entirely cleansed out, or will be like the manna gathered yesterday,
and loathed by those whose health and appetite is good,
and who can only be satisfied with wine well refined off the lees.
I doubt not, dear friend,
but you have anticipated in your own knowledge and experience
any broken hints which I can offer on this subject,
though I thus indulge an inclination of freely communicating my sentiments to you.
I own I do, above all things, love this most noble cause, our holy religion;
and I do believe, that you,
(among many others) have been called and qualified to bear public testimony to it.
I fear also, that several who have been thus called, have, by one means or other,
been prevented from coming up in that degree of burning
and shining lustre which was intended,
and so our poor society has missed the benefit (which it so greatly needs)
of the full degree and measure of instrumental help designed it,
to its very great and apparent loss.
My heart`'s desire is, that all of us,
who are touched with a sense that those things are so,
may diligently wait at the fountain head of wisdom and strength, that we may,
by fresh supplies, from there, be enabled to come up nobly in the stations,
severally allotted to us; neither going before, nor staying behind our proper ranks;
not going forth in the arms or habit of another,
nor in the presumption of strength before experienced;
but with the effectual (though to ourselves and others)
seemingly slight and contemptible weapons,
which, for the time being, it shall please divine wisdom to furnish us with.
So shall the Lord`'s strength be made perfect in our weakness:
our own souls comforted and encouraged to go on,
trusting in the sufficiency of every present supply;
and the church be edified by successful labour.
I commit us both to him, who alone can preserve us alive in the root,
and in his own time make fruitful in the branches.
I do very sincerely desire your preservation,
stability and advancement in your own particular,
and in a capacity to be more and more serviceable in the general; and am,
in true brotherly affection, your faithful friend

Letter 57.

The religion of some seems to consist in the remembrance of former experience,
a rational understanding of our principles and the discipline of the church,
a personal communication with some of the foremost rank,
and some faculty for speaking and writing on religious subjects; when in the mean time,
for lack of looking and living at home, for lack of watching unto prayer,
and waiting for renewed ability to offer the daily sacrifice on the fresh raised altar,
insensibility and incapacity gather strength, and leanness enters into our souls.

I take very kind, and as a mark of friendship, your advising me of the removal,
as well as the birth of your first born.
We naturally look about for those we love to communicate
with them our joys and our griefs.
Among the many alleviations of the miseries of human life,
a good and beneficent Providence has appointed one, called sympathy, by means of which,
our happiness is increased and our sorrow lessened, in the diffusing and dividing.
Good and gracious and kind indeed is he, with whom we have to do;
he knows the acuteness of our feelings and the sensibility of our hearts:
"`He does not afflict willingly,
nor grieve the children of men;`" and yet he sees fit to prove and try us,
with causing in our minds sensations of exquisite pain.
You are a man of reason and religion;
and it seems superfluous to suggest to you those considerations,
which might with propriety be thrown before many others,
such as that the Almighty Controller of the universe, does all things well;
that he only knows what`'s best for us;
that he afflicts with paternal chastisements for our good;
that these crosses and troubles are often concealed mercies and special favours:
that in any case, it is highly dangerous,
as well as improper to repine at the ordering of infinite wisdom,
and particularly in the case of a youth removed out of a vain, a perilous,
and a troublesome world, in his innocence:
when it is so uncertain how he would escape the temptations,
snares and pollutions which might annoy his longer life,
and endanger his everlasting happiness.
In reflections, such as these, you have (I doubt not) anticipated me;
but after all is said, which can be said, or read, or written,
unless our merciful Creator pours in the wine and the oil to our wounded spirits,
unless he visits with divine consolation, and raises, with divine support,
we shall never know true and solid comfort, help and strength to our poor minds,
under the pressure of the evils and infirmities which flesh is heir to.
May we be favoured to get low enough, conformed to our great pattern,
that so we may more and more closely company with him,
during the remainder of our pilgrimage, witnessing fellowship in his sufferings,
and being more and more baptized and qualified to
fill up our several stations in his church.
If this perishable life be desirable for anything, surely it is for this,
that we may be instrumental in our generations, to propagate, to show forth,
to spread by our conduct, and the gifts and talents which may be bestowed,
the glorious gospel which brings salvation among men.
Time is assuredly short to us all; during this short time we have only to labour.
Retribution is at the end.
As our works, so shall our rewards be.
If we can be termed by the Just Judge,
"`Good and faithful servants,`" we shall enter into the joy of our Lord.
May we set this prize, and keep it steadily in view, my dear friend.

We lost my dear mother, the day after you and I parted.
I believe she longed to be released from her house of clay, and made a happy exit:
I trust also,
that her righteous spirit is gathered to and united with the innumerable
company of the faithful of the generations that are gone before;
who had, many of them, little name or fame, or visible property among men,
but are now enjoying an eternity of happiness;
while those who had their portion in this life,
and lived in forgetfulness of the Great Giver, have met with a dismal reversion.

My father still keeps his own house, employs himself with the land,
and comes more frequently to us than he used.--He
is a favoured man and knows where best help,
under every difficulty, is to be had.
He is like one of the old patriarchs that dug a well,

My leisure from the duties of necessary business is small, and this leisure is,
(I hope) in a good degree occupied by the weightiest engagements in life.
There is a species of self-love or self-preservation, which it is not only lawful,
but absolutely necessary for us all to be possessed with; that is,
each to take heed to ourselves.
Here is uncertain, and hereafter is everlasting.
We should therefore diligently endeavour to improve
every fleeting opportunity while here,
to secure a hereafter of happiness.
The husband apart and the wife apart,
have each to work out (by diligent faithful labour)
this momentous task of their soul`'s salvation,
and to know it going forward with their day of renewed visitation.

The world is deceitful; its friendship is not to be trusted; its assistance to us,
in the hour of distress, is vain.
Religion (which is no other than acquainting ourselves with God,
and witnessing the peace which results from that
communion) is the help and ornament of life,
the hope in death, and the perpetual reward of its votaries in the world to come.
Let us be roused, my dear friend, by the calls of the spirit,
by the invitations of the church, by the work of the day,
and by the necessity of the times,
more and more to devote ourselves to the cause of Christ,
and his holy undefiled religion and way of worship of God, and of walking before men,
which the blessed Author established on earth by his precepts and visible example;
and which (after a long night of apostacy) our fore-fathers, in the last century,
were raised and enabled by power from on high, most nobly,
firmly and faithfully to revive and maintain.
Great and lamentable is the declension and blindness which has happened in our time,
to the successors of those honourable worthies,
professors of the same everlasting precious faith.
Our city is not only closely besieged by enemies from without,
but there are virulent enemies, hostile confederacies, deceitful allies,
and weak defenders, even within the verge of its walls.
The head (the skill and understanding) is in a great degree sick;
and the heart (the courage and zeal) is faint.
May the consideration of these things sink deep into our souls, and take root there;
let it cover our minds in secret, as sackcloth within upon our flesh.
Being dipped into sympathy with the seed under oppression,
and dwelling in the house of mourning therewith, we shall witness our hearts made better,
our inward man to be strengthened, and an offering prepared in us,
which will be a sacrifice of atonement for past delinquencies,
and an oblation acceptable in the sight of God.
To his holy keeping I heartily commend you,
and to the visits of his quickening grace and good spirit.
May it be the main employment of our lives,
to seek to dwell under the renewed influence of it!

I receive, with much satisfaction, the account of the increase of your family.
May there be increase of pure fear and diligent waiting for the sense of divine favour;

If there be any earnest desire for our own preservation,
if any anxious concern for the Christian cause,
if any humble willingness and care to make some return
for all the favours of our common benefactor,

I note your incertitude about settling, and that your desire is to be directed aright.
Human projects and prospects formed by the best share of mere reason are very fallacious:
and who expects or looks for any better direction in matters of such a nature?
Too few indeed have a right to expect any better; and yet my belief is,
that if we were so happy as to be enabled to be inward enough in our minds,
we should be favoured with a sense of what we ought to do and leave undone,
in affairs which seem (many of them) rather of a temporal than spiritual nature;
as the great apostle says, "`He that is spiritual judges all things.`"
I wish for you, dear friend, and for your brother to grow in this spiritual life;
that as divine Providence has blessed you with the
affluence of the good things of this world,
you may deeply ponder how the residue of the few, fleeting,
uncertain moments may be best employed, so as to possess sweet peace while here,
and insure an eternity of uninterrupted happiness hereafter.
We are not all called to one office; nor placed in one particular station in the body;
but we are all called to that life of simplicity, self-denial, plainness, humility,
and holiness, of which the great Author of Christianity set us and left us an example;
and having felt of the virtue which proceeds from a union with him,
we are called to show forth an example of his nature
by our conduct among our brethren and sisters,
the great fraternity of mankind, where ever we converse among them.
The greatest part (I suppose) of your juvenile days has been spent
among a numerous acquaintance in your good sense and active natural
understanding have doubtless influenced you to remark the beginnings,
the lives, and the ends of many of them, and you have said in your heart,
the religious man alone is happy.
According to my best sense +++_______+++ is the place for you, or its neighbourhood,
to spend the most of your future days in;
and may our common gracious Parent so reduce you by his power, so fit you by his wisdom,
so furnish you by his strength, that your latter days, as well as mine,
may be better than the former part of our lives, more steadily feeling after good,
more plentifully enjoying it, and more diffusely spreading the influence of it!

By good education and good example they may become very valuable members of society,
and reflect honour upon us all.
But if the seeds of pride and vanity,
if indifference and insensibility about the most important matters be cherished,
instead of being carefully watched and picked out,
they may miscarry in the primary and essential points,
as `'tis to be feared others have done before them; and then,
what signify all the riches and grandeur of this fading, transitory life?
"`What will it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?`"
Children in general,
(and children of such promising parts in particular) are a very important,
arduous charge: the subjects of solicitous, weighty care;
a forcible memento to us to be living, powerful lessons of example to them; coinciding,
and cooperating with the precepts, cautions and restraints,
which as we steadily and singly wait for it,
the Author of all our right abilities may be pleased to furnish us with wisdom to administer,

There is teaching in it.
This world is fluctuating and unstable, and its riches uncertain and perishing.
It is but a passage for us to another country, which is unchangeable,

These, or such like, I doubt not,

How my poor mind delights to see the children of the heavenly

bowing under his refining, purging power,
and submitting their necks to the yoke of Christ!--
Some such I think we have in this village,
to my great consolation in the midst of a variety of distress which I have to pass through,
and with these I have near unity and fellowship; indeed, my dear friend,
where there is not something of this savour to be felt,
conversation and company is to me often very insipid.
When I had the pleasure of being under your hospitable roof,
there did not open much way for converse of this sort; nevertheless, I could not but,
with particular satisfaction,
observe your willingness to dedicate your abilities to the service of the church there.
I am glad thereat, because I believe it to be an acceptable sacrifice,
when we offer and render up our best, though the best seems to us of little value.
Let us continue, dear friend,
to hold ourselves ready to do any little service which may be required of us:
let us diligently wait, and fervently pray for wisdom, that we may ever be preserved,
doing all we can, in our little sphere of action, for the truth, and nothing against it:

O these little foxes; what prejudice they do the tender vines!

bearing fruit to the praise of the good Husbandman,

People are too apt to dwell upon the disagreeable part of a character;
they do not make sufficient allowance for difference of humour, temper, opinion,

gives of it to the husband; he to his associates;

there is no cordiality of affection; and the friendship is only nominal,

We shall now in the meridian, and if we live to the decline of life,

I was glad to hear that you got something done with those litigious people
at +++________+++. Perhaps if the root of bitterness be not entirely eradicated,
yet what is left may die in the ground.
Cut a thing often down when it springs up, and it weakens its very root,
and at last it decays.
However the less thanks to them who will not help themselves;
who bind heavy burdens upon others, and will not lend a finger to remove them;
the less they will feel in themselves of the blessing which attends peace,
and the conciliators of peace.
Indeed I think it a happy circumstance, that there is no more litigation than there is,
among those who profess with us;
so few have about them the healing virtue which is most efficacious in these disorders;
because so few press through the crowd of opposing things,
with humility and faith to touch the lowest skirt of his garment,
from whom virtue proceeds.
I lament, dear friend, that a cause of the greatest importance to mankind,
should be so voluntarily deserted by many to whom
the Almighty has been manifold in his liberality,
whose situation and whose talents, properly disciplined and sanctified,
might render them serviceable in the church of Christ,
while they are vilely prostituted to the world;
at the same time that a multitude sit down contented
with a bare profession of belonging to a society,
whose principles they are very little acquainted with,
and to whose fame and character
(which should be bright and illustrious among the nations)
they add very little,
if they take not away very much from it by their visible conduct.
Yet, thanks to the merciful Creator!--who has not wholly repudiated his people,
though they have in the general allowed themselves to be defiled by other lovers;
there are to my certain knowledge (and I rejoice
in the prospect of it) several up and down,
whose names are respectable among men,
who yet have given up these names to serve as volunteers on the side,
and under the banner of Christ.
I know upon what ground I speak it.
Though separated in body from some of them, I am not so in spirit.
In my hours of retirement I have repeatedly found them, and you also, my dear friend,
among them.
I speak not only of past, but of late feelings.
Some indeed have not advanced with that steady pace
which becomes those who rank with the Lord`'s host,
and wear his eternal badge: they have received of his bounty,
and said they would enlist in his service;
but not being frequent enough among their fellow-soldiers,
nor sufficiently observing their Captain, and keeping near the standard,
they have halted (as between two opinions) fallen back, and lost ground:
so came not forward in the service which was designed,
for lack of learning the exercise and discipline at home,
and meeting frequently with their fellows in rank abroad.

The Lord grant that it may ever be the bond of our fellowship,

but we may be of use and strength to each other in
some of the conflicts which belong to this difficult,
dangerous state of existence;

Our own safe stepping, and the preservation of our families,
much depend upon keeping near their chiefest good; then a wider circle,
the welfare of the Christian society, of which we are members;
and a farther anxious concern for the happiness of our brethren and sisters,
the whole race of mankind the world over, to whom we are very closely allied;
being all made of one blood by the same great hand.
Too many spend little thought about these arduous engagements and relative duties;

Indeed there is manifold wisdom in the frequent contemplation of this great event:
it helps to humble, to rescind the too great luxuriance of a sportive imagination,

Since I received yours, I have attended the national meeting,
and from what I experienced in sundry of the sittings thereof,
am still more confirmed in sentiment, that the glory, life, power,
(or by whatever name we may call that which formerly overshadowed
the assemblies of our predecessors) has greatly departed from us,
collectively considered in this day.
It is a reflection which should cover our spirits with mourning; for no nation,
or people, or individual person, can suffer a more intimate loss,
than the loss of divine favour.
It should also deeply engage such of us as have been mercifully preserved,
yet to feel some little stirrings of life, to cherish, with all diligence,
this precious sense, that it may more and more increase in our hearts;
and by its spreading, expanding nature, catch hold of our nearest connections,
and kindle still more widely the sacred flame.
As long as we are a church militant, there will be, as there have been,
wrong spirits with which to conflict.
It needs must be, that offences come.
But by these encounters many virtues and ornaments of the
Christian church (the Lamb`'s wife) are manifestly exercised,
wisdom, temperance, meekness, patience, long-suffering, etc.
Oh, `'tis much to be lamented, that there is such a declension from the spirit,
and life and power of Christianity, in those called to revive the profession of it,
in life, and spirit and power.
My soul mourns deeply over the cause, because it is the cause of Christ Jesus;
a cause which rightly adhered to and rightly propagated among mankind,
would pull down the kingdom of Satan, release from his unmerciful yoke,
which deluded mortals foolishly and servilely wear, and make them inexpressibly happy,
both in this world, and that which is to come.
It is with pleasure, my dear friend,
that I find my mind free to converse with you on these subjects.
It is a demonstration to me,
that your heart is in a good measure offered willingly to the service of the day.
If there have been too many years of inattention, let the time past be sufficient:
and by diligent waiting and frequent retirement, let the latter growth be strong,
vigorous, and lasting.
Feeling, from time to time, after that power which causes a fresh dedication of all,
you will not only witness a getting dominion over these
weaknesses and foibles which have too easily beset,
and a growing in the saving experience of good,
but your inward peace and domestic happiness will be also increased
by seeing the spreading of the same divine virtue in your family;
and those who by the ties of nature and blood are near,
will be made still nearer and dearer by the bond of a spiritual relationship.

Alas! My friend, this is a day of weakness and distress, a day of stripping and famine.
It greatly behooves us to gird up the loins of our minds and be sober:
that if the Master shall please to bid us do anything in his house,
we may be ready to do it, and thereby obtain his approbation,
which is of more value than the smiles and favour of unstable men.
For my part, I think it is disreputable (humanly speaking) to be indifferent in,
or desert, or betray a good cause,
which we have avowed and confederated with others to support and maintain;
there is something very mean and ignoble in being false to one`'s trust,
and deceiving one`'s associates with whom we have
been linked together by sacred and solemn ties.
But when this cause is no less than that of Christianity itself,
the showing it forth by its fruits in our lives and conduct,
and the spreading of it among men, through the qualifications of the spirit;
as it is of the highest importance to be faithful to it,
for our own sake and the sakes of others,
so it is of the most dangerous consequence to act against it.
"`For, verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass,
one jot or one tittle shall in no way pass from the law till all be fulfilled.
Whosoever, therefore, shall break one of these least commandments,

Pain of body surely is enough for the poor creature to struggle with.

Indeed we are on manifold accounts debtors to our great Benefactor,
and this query we should often know to pass through us,
"`Say what shall we render to him for all his benefits?`"
and as this inquiry is made in sincerity,
we shall be likely to see and feel what he calls for in return at our hands: and this,
my dear friends, will be found to be no less than our all.
Our very existence;
that this existence is not wretched and miserable with pain and trouble here;
that we have comfortable and endearing connection of natural and spiritual fellowship;
that we have the means of decent and reputable support for ourselves and families,
and that if happily we are favoured to feel and feed
upon anything of a divine and supernatural kind,
which enables us to rub through the dangers and difficulties
of this troublesome uncertain life,
and gives a gladdening hope of a joyful eternity;
all these are owing to the special grace and mere unmerited favour of our Creator,

time and talents, to him and his service, as in the course of his wisdom,
and holy counsel, he shall call for them from us.
There is (in the confirmed apprehension of several) a visitation,
an invitation to the youth.
Some seem to have embraced it,
and to seek after the renewings of it upon their minds (without which they are not likely
to retain it savingly in their knowledge:) others bow down their heads as a bull-rush,
under the forcible weight of the copious gospel shower descending
from the instrumental vehicles of the clouds,
and anon raise them again to look about at the states of others,
or at the delusive splendours of a vain, deceitful world, to their hurt and hindrance:
and there are (it`'s to be feared) of such visited youth,
who have in their hearts departed from the sense of it,
and returned like the dog to his vomit,
or the sow that had been washed to wallow in the mire.
While I thus write, it has been repeatedly shown me, how carefully we,
who have arrived at the summit of the stage of conspicuous action,
and are seen in our several spheres, ought to handle the law and the testimony:
how careful we should be to let our conduct and conversation
shine instructively before all,
that we may not by any lightness (to which a constitutional
vivacity may bias us) give a kind of sanction,
or encouragement to such as are unsteadily sliding off the foundation
of inward conviction and chastening judgment in their own minds:
for indeed in my apprehension,
the failure to patiently learn these first rudiments of religion,
is the grand cause we have so few good scholars in the school of Christ.

Tis true his (+++_________+++`'s father) uniformly well-spent
life must afford him on the retrospection,
a conscious satisfaction; and I believe he has the purest and best consolations,
in as great degree and frequency as most men, yet he finds pain of body hard to bear,
and when the strength and flesh fail, and the gloomy path is begun to be trod,
nature shrinks at the approach of the final destruction of all that is visible,
and the best have occasion for all their best support to stand the shock, undaunted.
What then must the loose, the vain, the libertines,
who have given the lie by their conduct and conversation to a high and holy profession,
feel in that day and hour, when they have no oil in their lamps,

He ( +++_______+++`'s father) lived in watchful fear and circumspection:
he died in a holy confidence, triumphing over death and hell,
and yielding only that which was mortal and perishable to the grave.
The last words which he was heard to utter (and that only a short time before his departure)
were expressive of the help and comfort which he felt in the last extremity.
And when nature could not produce intelligible words,
his motion and gesture (well known to his intimates) were such as he would
often use when his spirit was raised in the dominion of the seed of life.
Since his translation, I feel to myself exceedingly weak,
sometimes greatly affected at this final separation, at other times more cheerful,
and thankful for the many domestic comforts remaining.

I doubt not but some of you wish for his return; but am also of opinion,

advantages may also accrue to you, from whom he is absent, by his absence.
If you do not feel your strength, you feel your weakness,

Change is the condition of our nature and place;
and the support and consolation which is alone sufficient to give firmness to our spirits,
and bear them up through and over all the changes which may await us,
is the blessed and unchangeable Truth; which whoever in honest simplicity adheres unto,
he or she may pass through good report, or evil report, may be cried up, or cried down,
may please or displease, in the estimation of changeable mortals;
but the present and future reward of such, is and will be sure:
even that substantial peace which the world is not able to give,
by all its gratifications and smiles; nor to take away by its persecutions and frowns.
And whoever departs, in heart, from this blessed principle of truth,
and makes flesh (or these reasonings and schemes which belong to flesh,) his confidence,
however he may be censured or commended by short sighted men,
who judge from outward appearances, and see not the heart;
yet such in that state are not under the divine approbation, but displeasure;
and their end, without repentance, will be miserable.
I wish you all may be disposed to make choice of the good part;
I am persuaded if that was generally the case with you,
a fountain would be opened in your family, to wash and to bathe in,
to drink and to be refreshed at, to your general joy and gladness;
for the good-will of heaven has, I believe hovered over you,
with blessings ready to be poured into your hearts, if prepared to receive them.
And as to you the elder children of so highly-favoured a family,
on whose account my solemn offerings have been often made, what can I say to you,
which you do not know?
You have not lacked clear discoveries of duty;
you have been favoured both with instruction and correction:
by the same powerful touch of a divine finger,
you have conceived a disrelish for the vain, unsubstantial gratifications of the world,
and a relish for those solid comforts which are in the precious Truth.
For the sake of your own standing and growth in that which is good:
for the sake of the powerful efficacy and influence
of good example within your sphere of action,
I beseech you, my beloved friends, above all things, cultivate, the gracious visitations,
which you have before experienced by frequent retirement,
and therein diligently seek after a renewal thereof upon your spirits.
Avoid, as much as in you lies,
everything which you find to unfit you for this holy commerce,
and let it be your principle watch and care to keep the vessel
clean (no matter how empty) which receives (when it pleases infinite
wisdom to communicate it) that most excellent treasure,
the joy of God`'s salvation.

Many changes happen in the course of time.
Nature in every part of it, within us and without us, is subject to change.
There is one principle of a spiritual kind, which changes not, neither waxes old,
nor decays.
Our spirits would do well to lay hold on it, to be leavened, regulated and guided by it.
We shall find no friend, no helper, no counsellor like it here, to steer us,
to sustain us through the perils and difficulties of this life;

with which our merciful Creator is pleased to favour us,
let us make good use of the present quiet and composure allotted, to cultivate, to renew,

You know, my dear friend,
that religious growth does not consist in writing and speaking on religious subjects:
it consists in the divine life prevailing in our minds.--Poverty of spirit is the plain,
decent, every-day clothing which properly belongs to, and becomes the Christian man.
This clothing makes us appear comely in the sight of the Master and of spiritual men.
When his followers patiently wear this garment, and keep it unspotted from the world,
in his own time (which they will find to be the best)
he will array them with robes of righteousness,
and garments of praise.
But then they must be stripped again of these which are the Lord`'s ornaments,
and possessing their souls in patience, must contentedly put on their old raiments,
the ordinary uniform of the master`'s servants.
Hence is seen the propriety of that expression of his to his disciples;
"`The poor you have always with you, but me you have not always.`"
Had there not been a word on this solemn subject in your letter,
it would have been very welcome to me,
because I know your time to mention that subject is not always ready.
What I was desirous of was, that, whether absent or present,
there might still be kept open a door of free communication
of sentiments on these matters between us,
by which some good might, and I think no evil could, enter.
I can say of a truth,
that fervent and renewed have been my desires and petitions on your behalf,
since I wrote last, and I trust your conflicts and besetments,
your sense of your own weakness, and of your lack of best wisdom,
your indisposition of body, your feebleness of mind, will all work together for good.
Certainly the good will of the Almighty Benefactor is towards you,
and good and gracious are his designs upon you.
Else, why should my poor spirit be so often dipped into sympathy with you,
and such petitions be formed in travail in the deeps, on your account?
Oh! Be faithful to the discoveries of the light which makes manifest,
and to the requirings of duty in the day of small things, and great will be your peace,
and glorious your reward; such as "`Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor has it entered,
or can enter, into the heart of the natural man to conceive.`"
Do not be restless, uneasy and impatient,
to quit your place of probation and present trial;
but rather use the more diligence (in proportion to the dangers and difficulties
of your situation) in seeking for inward strength and wisdom to be enabled
to acquit yourself acceptably in the sight of heaven.
Remember wherever we are, it is by the appointment, or permission of all-wise Providence,
who sees both us and our engagements.
It is not the way to gather strength of mind, to endeavour to fly in our own wills,
from the field of labour and battle.--Let us stand our ground,
keep close to the standard of Truth; if we cannot put an enemy to flight,
let us however not flinch ourselves, but openly declare and show on what side we are;
on the side of him who was never foiled in battle.
Thus, dear friend, you will grow stronger and stronger,
and feel "`The peace which passes all (rational) understanding,`"
to flow as a mighty stream in your soul,
bearing down before it all the little, trifling, hindering things,
and you will be able (as you are faithful and obedient)
to encounter things of greater importance and difficulty,
with honour and success.
So, in the love of our Holy Head, I affectionately salute you, and commit you,
with my own soul, to his divine protection.

If these means of fellowship between us were not used,
still I trust the root of friendship lives in our minds.
I knew in my best seasons, it produces good desires and petitions for my beloved friend.
Then, when Truth at the same time expands and prostrates the heart,
my prayers are for you, that you may submit to the operation of that power which reduces,
changes, and forms; that you may give up all with an unreserved dedication,
and simply be what the Lord would have you to be.
Long has he continued his favour to you; frequent and powerful have been his visitations.
Time flies on with unremitting speed; the end of all things approaches.
Happy will it be for those who have here, in all humility,
received the Truth in the love of it, have bowed their necks to its yoke,
and have not been ashamed to confess Christ in his lowly appearances before men;

Man was formed and designed by his Creator for religious, as well as civil society.
The spirits of the well-minded, met together, aid one another,
and a joint labour more readily opens the spring, which is much choked up by formal,
lifeless, lukewarm, as well as libertine, professors in our society.
Besides, it is the will of the common Father of his people, that his children shall,
at stated seasons, present themselves before him in a general way,
though Satan should come also among them; though in this mixed state of things,
the spirit of antichrist in a mystery should bear rule,
and prevail to spread a cloud over the assembly; yet is this enemy often rebuked,
and the cloud known to be dissipated, and the visited children made to rejoice together,
under the precious influence of unmixed good.
Of what use is your over-much thoughtfulness?
Or your looking too far before you?
It would be as well for you, I believe, if you were, in some respects, nearsighted,
like myself.
We are creatures as of a moment,
and should still endeavour to make the best use of the present moment,
which only is ours; doing in prudence and moderation what is in our power,
humbly dependant on the Author of the existence of our souls and bodies,
for his daily supply to both.

I do not wonder at worldly pleasures, worldly profits,

they see objects through a false medium.
Nothing less than a great supernatural power can change our vile affections,
and nothing less than the renewings of the same power can preserve them right,
when so changed.
A sense of this made David cry out, "`Create in me a clean heart,
and renew a right spirit within me.`"
And the apostle Paul most beautifully expresses--"`According to his mercy he saved us,
by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost.`"
This renewing then is what we have to wait to experience.
This transformation from the spirit of the world into the divine image,
must be effected and continued by the renewing of the mind.

May every feeble effort, and aspiration after the right thing,

I am persuaded you are diligent in improving your own stock;
though not making any ostentatious display of much trade,
too often the prelude of disreputable failures.
If you hold on in this little, low, frugal, industrious way,
I shall expect to find you rich.

There seems to be many promising youth up and down, many buds and blossoms,
but there is not produced proportionable fruit.
The plants seem wholly of a right seed,
and of the great and good Husbandman`'s right hand planting;
yet many of them miscarry in their growth: they get out of the fertile, penetrable,
yielding soil, and strike their roots into a stiff hard clay: or the branches,
for lack of pruning, grow too gross and run into timber;
or perhaps they are allowed to bear too much at once, while they are young.
Their strength is exhausted and they wither away.

I am sensible of many weaknesses and deficiencies attending me, and wish,
for the sake of the most noble cause which ever existed,
that I were a more able advocate for it.
However, if we faithfully do, according to the ability received,
what appears to be our duty,
though it may appear to ourselves and others a very little thing,
we shall not lack encouragement and help to go forward.
A little pure gold is far more valuable than a great deal of base metal.
So I wish you, beloved friend to be strengthened and encouraged,
and to love the littleness, and not think the day of small things long.
You have, I believe under right direction, put your hand to the gospel-plough;
neither look back, nor too far before you, nor about you,
at the spaciousness of the field of labour; but just turn up the furrow you are,
for the time being, engaged in, according to the present skill and ability afforded.
"`Whatsoever your hand finds to do, do it with your might,`" the present might;
and may the Lord Almighty bless and prosper, and increase that might,
to the honour of his great name, to the edification of his church,
and to your own solid peace!

I had some agreeable feeling conversation with dear +++_________+++,
who seemed inwardly strengthened and supported under this fresh trial,
which she met with,
on her return home from about three months labour in her Master`'s service.
Let us mark the economy of divine Providence, and his dealing with his faithful servants;
those that leave all for the gospel`'s sake,
shall receive the "`Hundred-fold`" (it`'s said) "`now in this time,`"

Great alteration indeed! His soul, which used to be like a well-watered garden,

Various are the dispensations which some have to pass through;
similar to those which attended the great Master.
He had a long fast, forty days and forty nights, and was sorely tempted;
but the text says, "`He was led up of the spirit`" into that wilderness.
And if we be led by the good spirit, all will be well; rejoicing and suffering,
feasting and fasting are in his hand; his visited children, disciples and followers,
have only patiently to abide under his government, who leads in the way of righteousness,
in the midst of the paths of judgment.

As we resign ourselves to the divine protection and ordering, by a wheel,
(as it were) within a wheel, he effects his gracious purposes concerning us,
which the contumacy of our own wills,
or the fallacy of our own contrivances might frustrate; happy would it be for us,
if we could lose our own wills in the will of God.
The flesh profits nothing in the work of religion;
religion which by all means should be the chief concern of our lives, the beginning,
the middle, and the end of our pursuits and desires.
Choose that good part, seek that first, and other things necessary will be added.

A little lapse of time furnishes many new subjects of remark,
and many concurring instances of the instability of human prosperity:
conspiring to manifest that in this world we shall all, in rotation, meet with trouble;
and that there is no permanent, substantial happiness, but in the comforts of religion.
Happy for those who lay the foundation of life on this rock,
and who are preserved thereon through all the perils
and changes which await this state of existence.
They too, in this world, will have their portion of trouble:
but that peace which passes all conception of the natural man,
will be their solace in the midst of outward affliction.
I heartily wish you, my dear friend, in particular, and your family in general,
to be partakers of this hidden treasure, which I believe many of you,
both elder and younger, know by past experience, not to be a mere speculative notion,
or product of a heated imagination; but a substantial, sure, and certain principle,
which, when possessed and retained, in renewed experience,
is sufficient to enable us to do and suffer all things as we ought.

The meetings are large, and instrumental help afforded in them: but what shall I say?
--a people professing the inward spiritual life and spiritual worship,
and holding the same forth to the world must be spiritually minded,
and dig deep down to the nether spring, the source,
the fresh supply of all right religious ability:
otherwise there will be a withering at the root, and decay at the heart;
although from the temporary showers which may fall from the clouds,
and the favourable aspect in which they are planted, there may be a fair semblance,
and enduring for a while.
My dear child, my spirit has often near unity with you,
and I often and fervently desire your stability in righteousness,
that you may not cut and carve, and seek anything for yourself, nor seek to be anything;
but when that which quickens and animates and refreshes a little is withdrawn,
then be like ashes, reduced to nothing, cold, inanimate as to religion.
So, patiently abiding in this low state,
the Lord will give beauty for (or instead of those) ashes, the oil of joy for mourning,
and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.
My children are indeed near my heart;
and their steady wise walking in all humility along the perilous path of life,
as it will be their own great interest, so it would be my exceeding comfort;
for in this world they as well as I must meet with trouble.
This is not the place of rest and respite and safety, but the field of battle;
in which if we be foiled, there is no second place of combat;

My dear children are often the subject of my prostrate petition,

and that he may graciously accept of them to be his
true and faithful servants in their generations.
This is what I wish and desire for my children:

Uncertainty and disappointment are the natural growth of this country,

Nevertheless, a degree of life attended,

have access to the place where prayer can be made,
and there to offer his humble, earnest, tender petition for himself and others;
but almost a total imbecility for any active service in discipline attended me;
and I thought a reproof for my folly rather than any encouragement succeeded
a few words thrown out in the course of transacting some affairs of discipline,
which I hope to heap up to myself,
and hide in my heart for my better government another time: live and learn.
Thus is verified the proverb, The rod and reproof give wisdom,
but a child left to himself, brings his mother to shame.
The rebukes of the Divine Spirit correct and amend our spiritual defects,
and cultivate our spiritual understanding in enlargement of service;
but he that is left and deserted of that guide, and waits not for its direction,

I feel somewhat like a father, or rather a grandfather,

yet rebukes it when he fears it makes too free with another.
To branch out too diffusively in the epistolary way has a snare in it.
A multitude of correspondents is troublesome,
and there is a danger of there being more leaves than fruit.
We are variously appointed:
some perhaps may be allowed to indulge their inventive faculty,
and a vein of imagination, which others would be inwardly hurt by attempting.
Each of us should keep within the limits of our own tether.
We are each of us expressly told,
(as our first parents were) what is the fruit forbidden to us severally,
and death in a greater or lesser degree follows, if we touch it.
I believe some anointed servants have been hurt by allowing
their imaginations to wander upon unprofitable subjects,
as well as reading unprofitable books, and writing to an unprofitable degree.
A great deal depends on such keeping their vessels clean: there is a defilement,
which though it be not gross,
yet renders the vessel unfit for the reception of the heavenly virtue; or,
if it be infused, it loses of its fine quality, and is adulterated.
But, says the apostle, the will of God is, that you should abstain from fornication,
and that every one of you should know how to possess
his vessel in sanctification and honour.
May it be your care, my dear child, diligently to wait for the renewal of that baptism,

I am not so solicitous about the permanence of our epistolary correspondence,
as I am about the permanence of pure love and real friendship between us.
Epistles, like testimonies and declarations, may cease, having had their day,
but fervent charity should abide undiminished.
When I was last in England,
I happened somewhere to hear that you had a propensity to write much:
I thought there was a danger in it,
and I knew not how to act more consistently with that friendship which I felt and expressed,
than to warn you of the danger.
I threw my then present thoughts together on the subject, and spread them before you.
I know not how I expressed them,
but I know I did not mean thereby to preclude the freedom of a fellowship between us,
which may be limited and enlarged according to our best feelings.

I kept no copy of my letter; if any word or expression in it escaped me,
which was capable of giving you offence,
I request you will be so kind as to quote it with the context; and I shall I hope,
either explain to your satisfaction or condemn it.
You speakers ought to be very ready to hear.
I have seen some very sensible seasonable reprehensions of yours,
which as they were well meant were also well taken.
Little cautionary hints often make up the most profitable,
though perhaps not the most pleasing part of a letter.
I thought it prettily expressed by Catherine Payton
long ago in a letter to a correspondent of hers;
"`I would not have you think that I write this to please the natural part; no,
far be it from me to offer the incense of flattery,
or even pain my friends with a recital of their excellencies:
true friendship needs no such weak supports;
but is rather pleased with judicious reproofs.`"

As to my ever going again to your land, or any of my children,
it is quite a matter of uncertainty, enveloped in the cloud of futurity.
I have earnestly desired, and especially of late,
that I might not be permitted to go here and there lightly and foolishly;
but that divine wisdom might be graciously pleased to order my way and guide my steps.
I am blind and weak and ignorant, I think in a great degree;
and if merciful help does not interpose,
I am sure I shall be able neither to stand nor go.
Some of superior abilities and strength may trust in one thing or another; but as for me,
I have nothing to trust to for the preservation and welfare of me and mine,
but the mercy and condescending notice of the Lord Almighty.

To +++_________+++

O what an element is divine love! in this the children of the light live, and breathe,
and move, and act: there is no infection here; it is clear, pure, and salutary.
I would be glad that that poor man was effectually conquered.
You are dear to me for having so followed, and been so guided in service,
as to be instrumental of good in his case.

Your prayers and your alms-deeds, your secret wrestlings of spirit,
and your private labours and communications will, no doubt, come up in memorial.

I believe you know that I received yours of the 5th of last month,
the contents are such as this state of existence often affords:
it is indeed a cup of mixture;
but then it is wisely mixed and tempered by the great hand.
It it not for us poor, blind, and ignorant creatures to say, What are you doing?
--but patiently to submit and reverently to bow in humble
persuasion that the judge of all the earth does right.
Well, it is glad tidings to me, that you are getting on so bravely;
and no doubt cause of deep humiliation and gratitude to you both,
that the arm of everlasting strength has been experienced
in such renewed and such effectual support.
This is great encouragement to proceed in the track of revealed duty.
I believe many have greatly hurt themselves,
and become lame and dwarfish all their lives long,
by letting in the reasoner and the discourager,
consulting too much human prudence and propriety, limiting the spirit,
which is the Holy One, starting aside from services like an affrighted horse on the road,
and being in great fear where no fear is.
But you, beloved friend, seem to have got out of the byways and crooked paths,
on to the high road for travellers, leading to the city of the great King;
and by continuing thus diligent, faithful, and devoted,
you will (I trust) know more and more distinctly the Master`'s will,
and be more and more strengthened to perform it.
So if it be consistent with Infinite Wisdom to prolong your life here,
you will be happy in yourself, and useful in the creation of God;
and if a short warning should summon you from this stage and conflict,
this mortal will put on immortality;
your sorrows here be changed into unmixed everlasting joy;
and your example and memorial will live, and teach, and preach to succeeding generations.

But alas, I am a poor weak, tottering creature, a much fitter object to be ministered to,
than qualified to minister to another.
You know where are hid your effectual supplies, and in whom are all your fresh springs.
Yet what I was made able to do, you may be sure I was quite willing and glad to do,
to travail, to beg and to pray for you.
I am glad that you are out on service: it is the way for you to grow strong,
and to get above the little glooms and recurring perplexities and despondencies,
which from various causes cast down and disquiet the soul.
By being thus employed, you will through exercise become a trained servant,
and be made capable to instruct others, your fellow servants,
in the duties of their places and stations, feeding not only the lambs,
but the sheep of Christ.
Go on then, my dear friend; be not afraid of the face of man,
nor ashamed of the cross of Christ.
I repeat, (I have often repeated it) for I seem to have little new to say,
--no matter if fresh life be on the offering,--I repeat, that nothing more glorious,
more dignifying, more beneficial to mankind,
and more worthy of the dedication of all our faculties to espouse and promote,
ever was let down from heaven to earth.
Not only true civilization of manners, and sound morality,
but life and immortality (i. e. immortal life) and
eternal salvation are brought to light,
are made manifest through the gospel:
a dispensation of which (I doubt not) is committed to you,
in order to advance according to your gift and measure, these great and glorious ends.

Richard Shackleton to Elizabeth Dale

Ballitore, 10th month 1762.

[.salutation]
Dear Cousin,

I perused your letter to my sister Rayton, and a secret sympathy,
strengthened by the affection of natural relation,
induces me to commence a correspondence with you.
I have lamented, dear cousin, that a person blest with a good natural understanding,
improved by a good education, descended from religious ancestors,
who were honoured with bearing a testimony to, and suffering for the cause of truth;
and who was doubtless as it were by birthright,
made sensible of the essence of true religion: I say,
I have lamented that such a one as you should,
through the subtlety of the serpent that beguiled Eve,
have been instrumental through the strong influence of your example,
to lay waste our Christian testimony relative to mixed marriages;
and which is a consideration still more grievous, long observation has proved this truth,
that few who have been overtaken in this great fault,
though favoured with the gift of sincere repentance, and it is hoped,
accepted in themselves, have ever after been of much service in the Society.

They have walked mournfully on their way,
through a path of inward and outward affliction,
and have been made as living monuments for others to take warning at, and beware;
thus you know, I believe, dear cousin, it has been with many,
and the opinion I have of your good sense makes me not fear
to give offence by this plain manner of writing,
at the same time that my sincere regard for your welfare and happy restoration,
makes me willing to drop any hint, which improved by your own reflection,
etc. may contribute in any little degree to that desirable end: but neither, dear cousin,
would I discourage you in the least from that good
resolution which you seem to have happily taken up,
of returning like the prodigal son to the Father`'s house.

I mention the evil of your transgression,
not because I believe you insensible of it yourself,
nor that I would increase the affliction of the afflicted, and add grief to your sorrow;
but as this offence has long appeared to me, to be of a grievous and complicated nature,
a stain, though not of the deepest dye, as some gross pollutions,
yet not easily worn out, you may with more humble prostration,
with more deep contrition of spirit, and with more steady attention of mind seek to him,
whose law you have transgressed, and taught others so to do, by the most cogent precept,
your own example.
And if this, dear cousin, be your constant, uniform, inward travail, and exercise,
to witness from day to day this baptism which alone can wash and make clean,
though your transgression has been of a nature which I think
I have repeatedly felt to be displeasing to the Almighty,
yet I hope by this means not only as you very sensibly writes,
you may be outwardly reinstated in the union of Our society, but will in his time,
perhaps in the deeps of trouble, witness that secret union and reconciliation with him,
which will be your present support to bear up your drooping head,
and be the joyful earnest and assurance of a rest in that kingdom where the evil one,
and his agents, cease from troubling, which in sincere affection is my desire for you.

[.signed-section-closing]
Our family`'s love, etc.
